The repository for the Hugo version of The Tech Teapot blog.

The hugo gallery shortcode is taken from [here](https://www.control-alt-del.org/posts/building-an-image-gallery-for-hugo/) and is based upon [fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

The site uses the [mainroad theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad/).

The site uses the [hugo-notice](https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice) theme component for providing helpful notices.

Hugo uses emojis. A cheat sheet for the codes is [here](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).
