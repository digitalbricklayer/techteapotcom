Why did a lot of network management applications emerge in the period 1995-200X?

Was the cause the emergence of the internet over a similar period? How can I find proof of this claim? The reason MRTG emerged was because of a desire to measure the traffic going over a 64K X.25 link to the internet at De Montfort University. The first version of MRTG is very simple and tied to the in/out traffic of the router installed at the university. Only later did it become more generic in the data it was able to process. In times prior to the internet emerging, there wouldn't have been an outlet to share their projects with the world and then to collaborate with other people in improving them. So, the emergence of the internet stimulated the creation of the projects but also enabled their sharing and group enhancement making the tools useful to a wider group of people.

Go back to my shareware disks in the office and do a survey of all of the network related tools.

Time to first contribution seems like an interesting measure for an open source project. In the case of MRTG, the first two contributions were within 40 days. The time between version 1.1 being released and version 1.6.
