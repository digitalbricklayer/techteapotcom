README - cisco_ip_acc_collect.pl

This is cisco_ip_acc_collect.pl V0.9

This Script gets IP-accounting data from a Cisco Router and generates output
that can be fed into MRTG.

Configzration:
--------------

First of all, I sugest you make a backup of your router config, before
you configure IP accounting and run this script... If something happens,
I've told you ...

In the networks you can enter the networks you like to analyse in the
following form:

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/CDIR		Name

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP Adress of the Network

CDIR            is the CDIR Bitmask
                /32 = 255.255.255.255
                /24 = 255.255.255.0
                /16 = 255.255.0.0 etc.

Name		Is the name of the network.
                This name can apear more than once.
                The traffic of all networks that have same 
                name will be added into one output.

In the .pl file you have to change some variables. See the .pl file for more
informations.

In the mrtg config file you can enter something like this:

Target[tagretname]: `cat /usr/local/mrtg/cisco_ipaccounting/log_test`

Running this script:
--------------------

I start this script with cron, yost before mrtg like this:

*/5 * * * * cramer /usr/local/mrtg/cisco_ipaccounting/collect.pl ; /usr/local/mrtg/mrtg /usr/local/mrtg/accounting.conf
