Welcome to MRTG
==================================================================

I bet you are eager to get going with the program.

All documentation is stored in the doc sub directory.

For installing on UNIX, follow the instructions in

  doc/mrtg-unix-guide.txt

If you want to setup MRTG on NT, read

  doc/mrtg-nt-guide.txt

There are many more documents in the doc directory. Look
at the

  doc/mrtg.txt

file for an overview.
