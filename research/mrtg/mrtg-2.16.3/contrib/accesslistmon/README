README file for Access-list Monitoring via MRTG

MRTG can be found at : http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html


What this script does :

Basically I wanted to monitor how many hits I had to a particular access-list for a Cisco
router.  Rather than having to login and type the necessary commands, I thought it would be
easier to write a shell script to do it for me.
As MRTG is a graphing program, you can do almost anything with it, it then came into the
equation that it is possible to graph it by feeding it into MRTG.


Please see the INSTALL file for further instructions.



N.B Please note I take no responsibility for any damage that is caused (not that it would I
dont think).
Feel free to modify the script any which way you wish.
