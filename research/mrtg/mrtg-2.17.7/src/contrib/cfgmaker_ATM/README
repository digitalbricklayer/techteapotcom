This is gutted code from the other CFGmaker_ATM.pl code.

This will pull the information from the Bay MIB for the SVC ATM setup and
then create a target for each channel in the ATM that is defined.

The Targets created can be sorted in the Indexmaker such that the Named ATM
channel will have all the Subchannels grouped together.

Enjoy.
