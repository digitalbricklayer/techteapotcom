Subject: New Module for MRTG

Hash: SHA1

I have "hacked" together a module for iptables. I used the ipchainacc
1.1.0 from the contrib directory. Here's the scoop;
Requires Perl

There is one argument required, and it can be any of the following;
filter
nat
mangle
You may extend the functionality, but it also requires editing the
script. To use, place the following in your mrtg.cfg;
Target[iptables]: `/path-to/iptables-accounting argument`

The script is probably ugly to perl gurus, but for a guy who has
never used perl, I think it's pretty good.
