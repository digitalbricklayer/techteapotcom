The following requirements/outstanding issues exist for OVMRTG.
===============================================================

Installation Version 0.2
------------------------

After installing MRTG and HPOV the following additional customisation 
needs to be done.
The file $rundir/installov.cmds should be modified to reflect the locations of 
1) the mrtg executables ($rundir)
2) the web output directory ($webdir)
3) the name of the cron file within $rundir ($cronfile)
4) the name of the root HTML file within $webdir ($roothtml). 
5) the name of the HTML rebuild file ($buildhtf)
6) the company name for display in the HTML ($company)
7) the directory where the HPOV databases exist {$OV_DB} ($ov_db)
8) the directory where snmpCol.conf is found {$OV_CONF} ($ov_conf)
9) Any command line changes to run the perl from within HPOV. May need
   full directory paths to both perl and ovmrtg scripts

NT:
Suggested defaults for the above items under NT:
3) mrtgkick.bat
5) buildht.bat
7) /OpenView/databases
8) /OpenView/conf

Then installov should be run from within the mrtg directory to 
update the scripts.

Next the perl script ovupdate should be run to create the new ovmrtgc.csv file

mrtgmenu then needs to be placed into $OV_REGISTRATION/C and be readable
by the group of users that might need to change mrtg targets. 
You will need to shutdown and restart ovw to see the menu items 
appear under the Misc menu. You do not need to do an ovstop!

The gif files for MRTG banner are located in the common directory 
$webdir for all the HTML's to reference a single copy.

ISSUES
------

It is assumed that the HPOV host is also the web server for MRTG 
so that mkdir's can be executed in the WEB directories.

As the target/s are selected from the HPOV screen, it is assumed 
that HPOV already knows what the read community names are for 
these devices. OVMRTG uses this fact to alleviate the need for 
it to know community names.

Little error checking and reporting is currently done. If someone is 
displaying the data collection screen then ovadd and ovdel will
fail and will NOT report failure to the user.

The SNMP sysName is used to create directories in the web area and is also
used for most file and web names for that device. As such, the system name
needs to be unique and set for each device that will be monitored. If it is
not set for each device then the IP address is used instead. 
Code that translates IP Address to sysname can be setup in ovsysnms 
and in cfgmakerov if desired. All directories, configs html files etc 
are produced for each target by the unique sysname.

At present the data collects into the snmpCollect directory forever. 
I've started to write a cleanup routine that will be able to keep 
only recent history. (see ovcullfile)

ovdel does not destroy the directories that are created for the deleted target
(a safety measure). If you want to clean them up it is currently a 
manual process.

Access
------

$rundir & $webdir files & directories should be rw for the group of people
that might be changing mrtg targets from within HPOV

$OV_CONF/snmpCol.conf needs to be rw for OVMRTG users

In the mrtg executable directory, the .cfg files are created. 
A file called 'collects' is also created as a work file. 
DO NOT create a file in this directory with this name.

CRON
----

cron needs to be setup by the user. Typically a line like this works:
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /opt/mrtg/run/mrtgc 2>/opt/mrtg/run/log 1>&2
The equivalent job should be setup under NT. 
OVMRTG should not care if the host is Unix or NT.

The end of ovadd and ovdel may be customised to perform extra tasks 
by the cron job.

Usage
-----

Once setup, the user selects the OVMRTG target/s from the OV screen.
The Misc menu item is then selected, followed by Mrtg Actions and 
then select either the 'Add/Update' or 'Stop collecting' options. 
The third option, Show MRTG Targets, works on Unix systems ONLY at
present. I only have the UNIX NNM developers kit. This option
'selects' the current targets on the screen for easy updates. 

To understand what happens for an add/update, see the file newrtrov.txt
