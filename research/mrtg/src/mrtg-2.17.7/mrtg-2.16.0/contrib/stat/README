stat.pl
    
    You could use this script to monitor youre DNS activities.
    Its a very simple perl script and youre free to do any updates on
    it, but please send a copy to me calle@volvo.se.
    you have to do some small changes like hostname and path to named.stats.
    if youre using it please let me know so i could send you updates.


INSTALLATION:
    
    To get it to work do execute the script once before you make mrtg to do
    it for you. This will make an OLD file with the last requested queries.
    You might get an error messages , but the next time you execute it the
    stats will come as you want it.



USAGE:
    
    If you run this on a DNS server just add an script that will make a stat
    file (Bind 4 (kill -ABRT `/var/run/named.pid`)), 
    (Bind 8.1. (kill -ILL `/var/run/named.pid)) and remove the old named.stats.
    and put this into cron.
    For Bind 8.2.1 you will need to be using ndc (ndc stats).
    
    ex. script to run from cron

    #!/bin/sh
    rm /var/tmp/named.stats
    kill -ABRT `cat /var/run/named.pid`
    <PATH to MRTG>/mrtg  <PATH to mrtg.cfg>


MRTG:
    
    To set up this in MRTG:
    Target[dns]: `/<PATH to stat.pl>/stat.pl`

REMOTE:
   I did a small script called dns.named that will collect named from a
   remote DNS, but i strongly recomend to rewrite this so instead of using
   FTP use scp.
   this script requires expect.

  
UPDATES:
   
   The new stat.pl you could use 2 diffrent graph in one session , that is lets say you want to
   logg all Requested queries and maybe count of zone transfers.
   all you have to do is to specify these in $OUTGOING and $INCOMING in stat.pl.
   The script also looks how for how long the named have been runing without a reset.
