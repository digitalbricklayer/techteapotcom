Hey Tobias,

        I was fooling around with your wonderful program and I ended up
hacking out a script and config to produce Modem statistics for Livingston
Portmasters. You can see the results at
http://www.nantucket.net/users/admin/pmgraph/ if you're interested . I've
enclosed my work here since, maybe you can post it somewhere and save other
Portmaster owners some work.

        Your Nantucket postcard is on it's way!
