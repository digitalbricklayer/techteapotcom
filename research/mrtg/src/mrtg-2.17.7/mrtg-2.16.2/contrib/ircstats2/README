ircstats2.pl v1.3 (06/04/2001)

ircstats2.pl is a perl script I use to monitor
the user load of the Langochat.net IRC Network.
- Lucas Nussbaum <lucas@schickler.net>
Homepage : http://www.schickler.net/lucas/ircstats2/

Usage :

All the configuration is done in ircstats2.pl.
You can look at example.cf to learn how to configure mrtg with this script.
To restart the script if it crashes (this soft is supposed to be bug-free,
so that shouldn't happen), you can use the crontab script included.

Changes :

1.3 (21/03/2001)
	- Now counts servers and ircops too.
1.2 (25/01/2001)
   - Better calculation of the global user load, when the list of servers
     isn't up to date.
   - Now counts the number of channels too :)
   - Can display the global users and channels count in plain text file,
     enabling those files to be used in other scripts.
      
1.1 (24/08/2000)
   - Initial public release
