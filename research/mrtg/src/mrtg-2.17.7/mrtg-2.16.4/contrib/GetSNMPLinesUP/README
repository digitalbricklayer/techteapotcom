GetSNMPLinesUP.pl checks some SNMP  variables for a certain  value and
returns their sum  in a format used to  feed values to MRTG.  This was
written   in  RedHat Linux  3.0.3 with    a   2.0.29 kernel  with perl
5.003. Other SO's may vary. Use at your own risk :>

As usual no  time  to write  much  documentation.  As usual  read  the
source,   send   me  questions,  comments,   changes, improvements and
patches.


I have to thank the following people:

- Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch> and Dave Rand <dlr@bungi.com>
for MRTG.

-  Peter   W. Osel <pwo@guug.de> from  whom    I've ripped the README,
INSTALL and COPYRIGHT file  format from his wonderfull mrtg-ping-probe
