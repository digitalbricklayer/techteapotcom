Here are some scripts i modified to monitor the modem utilization
of my USR Total control racks.  They work great even though I am 
not a programmer.  If there is anything you see that would work 
more efficiently it would be appreciated.
The files are as follows

dualt1.pl    - TCH with dual t1 card.
dualpri.pl   - TCH with dual pri card.
hiperdsp.pl  - TCH with hiperdsp cards.
mrtg-cfg.txt - snippet of cfg file
