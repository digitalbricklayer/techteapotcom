#--- sample ipchains rules for accounting

# Flush the rules in case they exist already
/sbin/ipchains -F acctin
/sbin/ipchains -F acctout

# add the new rule chains
/sbin/ipchains -N acctin
/sbin/ipchains -N acctout

# add empty rules to the new chains just for accounting
/sbin/ipchains -A acctin
/sbin/ipchains -A acctout

# insert rules into the input and output streams.
# Packets will first pass through these rules before
# returning to the other rules in the chains
# You might not want this if you are trying to 
# completely ignore certain hosts.
/sbin/ipchains -I input -j acctin
/sbin/ipchains -I output -j acctout

# if you wanted to narrow the accouting to a single IP
# you could do these lines instead of the above 2 (not tested)
# (assuming your IP address was 192.168.1.1)
#/sbin/ipchains -I input -d 192.168.1.1 -j acctin
#/sbin/ipchains -I output -s 192.168.1.1 -j acctout

# By changing the rules, you can make it filter only exactly
# what you want as long as it jumps to acctin, or acctout.
# Be careful not to double count packets though.
