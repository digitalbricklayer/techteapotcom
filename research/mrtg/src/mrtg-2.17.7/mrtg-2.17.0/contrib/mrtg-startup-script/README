Subject: mrtg startup script

Hi,

while discussing on a fedora irc channel about a startup script
(/etc/init.d/mrtg) for the mrtg daemon we came to a conclussion that it
would be the best to include such a script in the main sourcecode
distribution. Many people don't run mrtg through cron and a startup script
is very handy. But we don't want to confuse them while installing a startup
script + a cron file. The best sollution we came out would be to include a
startup file in the contrib directory of mrtg. There is also a bugzilla
entry for the file and a little conclussio. Maybe you could add the file to
the contrib directory so that it's easier to run mrtg as a daemon.

Best regards,
Stefan
