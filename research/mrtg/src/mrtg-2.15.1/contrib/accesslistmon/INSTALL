INSTALL file for Access-list Monitoring via MRTG


First there are a few pre-requisites required in order to get the scripts going :

A. MRTG :), which can be downloaded from :-
http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html

B. A Cisco Router.

C. Rsh enabled on the Cisco Router, this is done as follows :

ip rcmd rsh-enable <--- Enabled the 'rsh' command/feature.
ip rcmd remote-host root x.x.x.x root enable <---- Allows the username of root from the
host x.x.x.x to execute commands via rsh.

Once these commands have been enabled on the router you will be able to start executing
commands using 'rsh' from the shell of the machine you have allowed access from, I suggest as
an example try the following :

rsh x.x.x.x sh ru

If successful it should return a copy of you current 'running config' to the screen
If you get an error message like this 'Permission denied.' Please check the rsh enable feature
on the router to make sure you allow access for that host/username.

Copy the scripts (which I have included in this package) into an appropriate directory to run
from, example I use the following :
/usr/local/mrtg/configs/accesslist
Its up to you what you use.

Also make sure the scripts are executable 'chmod 755' should do the trick.

I have also included a copy of the mrtg.cfg file required to run the scripts and feed them
onto the graph, this has the filename mrtg.cfg included in this package.

There is one slight problem which I havent worked out as yet (if someone could help, hint,
hint) is that when MRTG doesnt receive an integer for 'out' in other words if the access-list
has returned 0 matches it will display an error message, the graph will still plot.  This can
be very annoying if you are running it from cron, as you mailbox can get filled up with cron
error message, in my case I filter them to /dev/null using procmail.

Thats it!
