Tobias,

I have included a new module "PMLines.pl" for the "contrib" directory which
replaces "PM3Lines.pl" and the new module now supports both Livingston PM2
and PM3 servers.

	Dear Tobias,

	Here's another script for contrib. It allows one to make a
	graph of analog/ISDN lines on a Livingston Portmaster 3. No
	docs, sorry...

Here is a new modified version of the PMlines.pl script. This one works 
with the newest version of PortMaster 4 firmware and all other Portmaster 
2/3/4 products.

# 2000/9/19
#
# Modified again by Robert Boyle (robert@tellurian.net) to work with
# all Lucent Portmaster 2/3/4 chassis. Now uses port speed to determine if
# call is ISDN or analog. If speed is 56000 or 64000 then call is ISDN.
# This may cause a false ISDN reading if someone has a perfect v.90 connection.
#
# Changed name back to PMlines.pl
