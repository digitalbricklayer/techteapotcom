Again I must state that this does no error checking what so ever. Just a
quick hack to get me the results I needed.

I have modified mrtgV2 to record stats based on interface ip address instead
of Interface number. It does not do all the great errorchecking and no OS
testing but it is functional for my needs.

applie the patch by typing 

patch <contrib/mrtg-ipget/mrtg-ipget.patch

example for the mrtg.cfg
