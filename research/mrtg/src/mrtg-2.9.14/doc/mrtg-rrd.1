.SH "NAME"
mrtg-rrd \- How to use RRDtool with \s-1MRTG\s0
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
After using \s-1MRTG\s0 for some time you may find some limitations. Mostly in the
areas of performance and graphing flexibility. These are exactly the areas
addressed by rrdtool. To learn more about RRDtool check out its website on
.PP
.Vb 1
\& http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool
.Ve
.SH "RRDTOOL INTEGRATION"
.IX Header "RRDTOOL INTEGRATION"
When using mrtg with RRDtool you are replacing \fIrateup\fR with the
RRDtool perl module \fIRRDs.pm\fR. To enable RRDtool support in mrtg
you have to add the line
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LogFormat: rrdtool
.Ve
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 needs access to both the RRDtool perl module \fBRRDs.pm\fR and to the
\&\fBrrdtool\fR executable.
.PP
If these two items are not installed in locations where perl can find them
on its own, then you can use the following two parameters to supply the
appropriate directories.
.PP
For the location of the \fBrrdtool\fR executable you put
.PP
.Vb 1
\& PathAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/bin/
.Ve
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\& PathAdd: c:\errdtool\ebin
.Ve
For the location of the perl module it would be:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LibAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/lib/perl/
.Ve
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LibAdd: c:\errdtool\ebin\elib\eperl
.Ve
When you have made this modification to the configuration file, several
things will happen when you run mrtg again with the new config file:
.Ip "1." 4
mrtg will take all your old \f(CW\*(C`.log\*(C'\fR files and \fBconvert\fR them to \f(CW\*(C`.rrd\*(C'\fR
format. (The \f(CW\*(C`.log\*(C'\fR files don't get touched in the process, so if things
don't work out they are still there.)
.Ip "2." 4
mrtg will use \fBrrdtool\fR to update its databases. These will have a new format
called \fIrrd\fR which is totally different than the native \fIlog\fR format of
the classic mrtg.
.Ip "3." 4
mrtg will \fBnot\fR create any webpages of graphs anymore.
It will only query the routers for traffic information and update its \fIrrd\fR
databases.
.PP
The advantage of whole thing is that the mrtg will become \fBmuch\fR
faster. Expect the runtime to drop to 20% of the previous value. (I would like
to get some feedback on this from folks with large installations)
.PP
Mind you though, while the logging process of RRDtool is \fBvery\fR fast, you
are also gaining some time by neither creating graphs nor updating webpages.
The idea behind this is that it is more efficient to create
graphs and webpages on demmand. Using a cgi script.
.PP
At the moment there is no \fBofficial\fR script to do this, but two
contributers have created such scripts:
.Ip "\fB14all.cgi\fR" 4
.IX Item "14all.cgi"
Was the first program to take over the webpage creation and graphing task.
It has been developed by Rainer\ Bawidamann\ <Rainer.Bawidamann@informatik.uni-ulm.de>. You can find a copy 
on Rainers website:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& http://www.uni-ulm.de/~rbawidam/mrtg-rrd/
.Ve
The program comes with its own documentation
.Ip "\fBrouters.cgi\fR, \fBservers.cgi\fR and \fBgeneric.cgi\fR" 4
.IX Item "routers.cgi, servers.cgi and generic.cgi"
are other cgi frontends to mrtg running with rrdtool. Thier main difference
to 14all is, that the web pages it creates are much more stylish than the
ones from mrtg. These tools have been written by Steve\ Shipway\ <steve.shipway@adsweu.com>. You can find a copy in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& http://www.cheshire.demon.co.uk/pub/
.Ve
The scripts comes with their own installation instructions.
.SH "FUTURE"
.IX Header "FUTURE"
Just as a side note: \s-1MRTG-3\s0 will be based entirely on rrdtool technology.
But don't wait for it ... get going \fBnow\fR!
