Hi Tobi,

A collegue and I did some improvements in the get-active.pl
script written by Russ Wright in the contrib directory.

get-active2.pl does a summary page of all the router interfaces
being monitored and it proved to be very useful.

I'm not able to contact Russ but feel free to pass the code
around.

Rgds,
weemeng
