Because there is no default policy for user-chains, you have to insert a
rule which counts all pakets/bytes going through the chain.
You can do that by inserting (must be the first rule in the chain) a rule
like :

iptables -t filter -A httpin

in your mrtg config file you have to add a line :

Target[iptables]: ´/firewall/stats/mrtg/iptables_acc httpin httpout´
