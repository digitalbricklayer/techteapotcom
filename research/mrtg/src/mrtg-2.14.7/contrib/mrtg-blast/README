Please read the INSTALL file after finishing this.

I would like to express my thanks to

Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch> and Dave Rand <dlr@bungi.com>
for writing MRTG. It's people like them that make me believe
all software designed for hazardous environments such as
missile and aircraft guidance systems should be run under GNU 
and Copyleft. This would have spared many lost lives and many
to come.

Many thanks also to Daniel Karrenberg <dfk@nic.eu.net> for porting
tcpblast to Linux!

And last - but definitely not least - Peter W. Osel <pwo@guug.de>
who wrote mrtg-ping-probe which inspired me and helped
getting along with perl regex syntax ;)
