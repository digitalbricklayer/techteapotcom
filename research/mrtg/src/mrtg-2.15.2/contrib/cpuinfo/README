This script allows mrtg to monitor cpu usage for both system and user on linux
and sun solaris.  

All of the information you need to set it up, including a sample cfg file
is documented in the header of the script itself.  If you have any questions, 
you can email me at schu@schu.net and I'll try to get back to you.

Hope it works for you as well as it does for me :)

PLEASE NOTE THAT I NO LONGER WORK FOR 7X.  DO *NOT* SEND EMAIL TO SCHU@7X.COM.
THAT ADDRESS IS NOW ALIASED TO THE 7X GENERAL MANAGER.  ANY MAIL SENT THERE WILL
GO TO THE WRONG PERSON.  Apparently 7x is to lame to remove my old address and let 
the server bounce it.
