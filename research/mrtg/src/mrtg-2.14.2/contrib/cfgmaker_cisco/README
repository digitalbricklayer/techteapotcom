Folks,
     Jon Snyder here at Portland State University, made some
modifications to the CFGMAKER file which instead of just returning
an incrimenting port number on the graps, actually makes the following
type of lable:
Port 4/3, Vlan 128 , multi mode fiber fast ethernet

     This version also grabs and shows all non-VLAN1 VLANS in a
different color, plus provides aggregate VLAN traffic stastics as well by
finding out what ports are in the VLAN, then adding those ports together.
This means of course that a port will be "hit" however many times it is in
a VLAN.
     Anyhow, as it is such a small file, I included it as an
attachment. We don't exacily have the time to provide support for this
CFGMAKER modification, but if you have questions or comments, please
direct them to JON@PDX.EDU.
