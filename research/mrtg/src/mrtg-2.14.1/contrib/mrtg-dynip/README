Mrtg-dynip is a contribution to MRTG, enabling MRTG to generate multi
interface traffic graphs for IP interfaces on hosts that do not provide
consistent SNMP target numbers for their interfaces.  Such IP interfaces
include IP active serial interfaces attached to modems in a PPP dial in
environment. The hosts must run snmp agents.  For completeness, information
about interface devices with unvarying SNMP target numbers, such as
ethernet cards, can be configured to be included.

Mrtg-dynip can be considred to have sophisticated modem bank monitoring
capacity, when the modems carry PPP or SLIP traffic.

Regenerates a named 'mrtg.cfg' file to ensure snmp data remains with a
consistent IP number, or overridable IP number of a real physical device
in a dial in IP environment, rather than with an interface name which
can get assinged to different real physical devices, and runs mrtg on
the generated file.

Generates a web index file of stats web pages.

Mrtg-dynip's configuration is simplest where static (or fixed) IP is not
used for dial into a rotary modem pool.

The package is oriented towards UNIX systems, there is no reason mrtg-dynip
should nor run under Windows NT, some comments are made relevant to this. 
Please note the first task under Windows NT is to ensure the UNIX new lines
are converted to DOS new lines or are readable.

If you use this please let me know.  If you would also like your site to be
