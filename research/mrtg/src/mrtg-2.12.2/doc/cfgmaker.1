.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBCfgmaker\fR creates \s-1MRTG\s0 configuration files based on information
pulled from a router or another \s-1SNMP\s0 manageable device.
.PP
[\fIcommunity\fR\fB@\fR]\fIrouter\fR
.PP
\&\fICommunity\fR is the community name of the device you want to create a
configuration for. If not specified, it defaults to '\fBpublic\fR'; you might
want to try this first if you do not know the community name of a
device. If you are using the wrong community name you will get no
response from the device.
.PP
\&\fIRouter\fR is the \s-1DNS\s0 name or the \s-1IP\s0 number of an SNMP-managable device.           
Following the name you can specify 6 further options separated by                 
colons.  The full syntax looks like this:                                      
.PP
\&\fBrouter\fR[:[\fBprt\fR][:[\fBtmout\fR][:[\fBretr\fR][:[\fBbackoff\fR][:\fBvers\fR]]]]]
.PP
Of special interest may be the last parameter, \fBvers\fR.  If you set this to
\&'2' then your device will be queried with \s-1SNMP\s0 version 2 requests. This
allows to poll the 64 bit traffic counters in the device and will thus work
much better with fast interfaces (no more counter overrun).  Note that the
order in which the routers are specified on the command line do matter as
the same order is used when the configuration file is generated.  The first
specified router has it's configuration lines genrated first, followed by
the lines belonging to the next router and so on.
.PP
Note that the first line of the generated cfg file will contain all the
commandline options you used for generating it. This is to allow for the
easy 'regeneration' in case you want to add newhosts or make some other
global change.
.Sh "Configuration"
.IX Subsection "Configuration"
Except for the \fB\-\-output\fR and \fB\-\-global\fR options, all options affect
only the routers following them on the command line.  If an option
specified earlier on the command line reappears later on the command
line with another value, the new value overrides the old value as far as
remaining routers are concerned.  This way options might be tailored for
groups of routers or for individual routers.
.PP
See \fB\-\-output\fR and \fB\-\-global\fR for how their behaviour is affected by
where or how many times they appear on the command line.
.PP
See the \fBExamples\fR below on how to set an option differently for
multiple routers.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print a brief help message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "--man"
Prints the manual page and exits.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the version of cfgmaker.  This should match the version of \s-1MRTG\s0
for which config files are being created.
.IP "\fB\-\-ifref\fR \fBnr\fR|\fBip\fR|\fBeth\fR|\fBdescr\fR|\fBname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ifref nr|ip|eth|descr|name"
Select the interface identification method.  Default is \fBnr\fR which
identifies the router interfaces by their number.  Unfortunately the
interface numbering scheme in an \s-1SNMP\s0 tree can change. Some routers
change their numbering when new interfaces are added, others change
thier numbering every full moon just for fun.
.Sp
To work around this sad problem \s-1MRTG\s0 can identify interfaces by 4
other properties. None of these works for all interfaces, but you
should be able to find one which does fine for you. Note that
especially ethernet addrsses can be problematic as some routers have
the same ethernet address on most of their interface cards.
.Sp
Select \fBip\fR to identify the interface by its \s-1IP\s0 number. Use \fBeth\fR to
use the ethernet address for identification. Use \fBdescr\fR to use
the Interface description. Or use \fBname\fR to use the Interface name.
.Sp
If your chosen method does not allow unique interface identification on
the device you are querying, \fBcfgmaker\fR will tell you about it.
.IP "\fB\-\-ifdesc\fR \fBnr\fR|\fBip\fR|\fBeth\fR|\fBdescr\fR|\fBname\fR|\fBtype\fR|\fBalias\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ifdesc nr|ip|eth|descr|name|type|alias"
Select what to use as the description of the interface.  The description
appears in the \f(CW\*(C`Title[]\*(C'\fR property for the target as well as the text header
in the \s-1HTML\s0 code defined in the target's \f(CW\*(C`PageTop[]\*(C'\fR.  Default is to use
\&\fBnr\fR which is just the interface number which isn't always useful
to the viewer of the graphs.
.Sp
There are 6 other properties which could be used.  Use \fBip\fR if you want
to use the interface's IP\-address.  Use \fBeth\fR if you want to use the
interface's ethernet address.  If you want a better description, you can
use either \fBdescr\fR, \fBname\fR or \fBalias\fR.  Exactly what each of these do
varies between different equipment so you might need to experiment.  For
instance, for a serial interface on a Cisco router running \s-1IOS\s0 using \fBname\fR
might result in \f(CW"S0"\fR being the interface description , \fBdescr\fR might result
in \f(CW"Serial0"\fR and \fBalias\fR might result in \f(CW"Link to HQ"\fR (provided that is
what is used as the interface's \f(CW\*(C`description\*(C'\fR in the router's configuration).
.Sp
Finally, if you want to describe the interface by it's Btype
(i.e \f(CW"ethernetCSMA"\fR, \f(CW"propPointtoPoint"\fR etc) you can use \fBtype\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-if\-filter\fR '\fBfilter-expression\fR'" 4
.IX Item "--if-filter 'filter-expression'"
First of all, this is under some developement and is experimental.
.Sp
Use this if you want to have better control over what interfaces gets
included into the configuration.  The \fBfilter-expression\fR is evaluated
as a piece of Perl code and is expected
to return a truth value.  If true, include the interface and if false,
exclude the interface.
.Sp
For a further discussion on how these filters work, see the section
\&\*(L"\s-1DETAILS\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1FILTERS\s0\*(R" below.
.IP "\fB\-\-if\-template\fR \fBtemplate-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--if-template template-file"
First of all, this is under some development and is experimental.
.Sp
Use this if you want to control what the line for each target should look
like in the configuration file.  The contents of the file \fBtemplate-file\fR
will be evaluated as a Perl program which generates the lines using certain
variables for input and output.
.Sp
For a further discussion on how these templates work, see the section
\&\*(L"\s-1DETAILS\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1TEMPLATES\s0\*(R" below.
.IP "\fB\-\-host\-template\fR \fBtemplate-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--host-template template-file"
First of all, this is under some development and is experimental.
.Sp
Use this if you want to have some extra targets related to the host itself
such as \s-1CPU\s0 utilization, ping response time to the host, number of busy
modems etc.  The contents of the file \fBtemplate-file\fR will be evaluated
once per host as a Perl program which generates the lines using certain
variables for input and output.
.Sp
For a further discussion on how these templates work, see the section
\&\*(L"\s-1DETAILS\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1TEMPLATES\s0\*(R" below.
.IP "\fB\-\-community\fR \fBcommunity-string\fR" 4
.IX Item "--community community-string"
Use this to set the community for the routers following on the command
line to \fBcommunity-string\fR.  Individual routers might overrride this
community string by using the syntax \fBcommunity\fR\fB@\fR\fBrouter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-ipv6\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-ipv6"
This option enables IPv6 support. It requires the appropriate perl
modules; if they are not found then IPv6 is disabled (see the ipv6
documentation).
.Sp
cfgmaker will use IPv6 or IPv4 depending on the target. If the target
is a numeric address, the protocol depends on the type of address. If the
target is a hostname, cfgmaker will try to resolve the name first to an
IPv6 address then to an IPv4 address.
.Sp
IPv6 numeric addresses must be specified between square braces.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& cfgmaker --enable-ipv6 [2001:760:4::1]:165:::2
.Ve
.Sp
If the target has both an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address with the same
hostname, cfgmaker first queries the target using IPv6 and falls back to
IPv4 if it fails. This is useful for targets which don't support \s-1SNMP\s0
over IPv6.
.IP "\fB\-\-use\-16bit\fR" 4
.IX Item "--use-16bit"
This option forces the use of 16bit \s-1SNMP\s0 request IDs.  Some broken \s-1SNMP\s0
agents do not accept 32bit request IDs.  Try to avoid this option as much
as possible, complain to your agent vendor instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-snmp\-options\fR  :[\fBport\fR][:[\fBtimeout\fR][:[\fBretries\fR][:[\fBbackoff\fR][:\fBversion\fR]]]]" 4
.IX Item "--snmp-options  :[port][:[timeout][:[retries][:[backoff][:version]]]]"
Use this to set the default \s-1SNMP\s0 options for all routers following on the
command line.  Individual values might be omitted as well as trailing
colons.  Note that routers might override individual (or all) values
specified by \fB\-\-snmp\-options\fR by using the syntax
.Sp
\&\fBrouter\fR[:[\fBport\fR][:[\fBtimeout\fR][:[\fBretries\fR][:[\fBbackoff\fR][:\fBversion\fR]]]]]
.ie n .IP "\fB\-\-global\fR \fB""\fR\fIbla: abc\fR\fB""\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\-\-global\fR \fB``\fR\fIbla: abc\fR\fB''\fR" 4
.IX Item "--global ""bla: abc"""
Use this to add global options to the generated config file. 
You can call \fB\-\-global\fR several times to add multiple options.
The line will appear in the configuration just before the config for
the next router appearing on the command line.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& --global "workdir: /home/mrtg"
.Ve
.Sp
If you want some default Options you might want to put
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& --global "options[_]: growright,bits"
.Ve
.Sp
Specifying \fB\-\-global\fR after the last router on the command line will
create a line in the configuration file which will appear after all the
routers.
.IP "\fB\-\-noreversedns\fR" 4
.IX Item "--noreversedns"
Do not try to reverse lookup \s-1IP\s0 numbers ... a must for \s-1DNS\s0 free environments.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-down\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-down"
Normally cfgmaker will not include interfaces which are marked
anything but administratively and operationally \s-1UP\s0. With this
switch you get them all.
.IP "\fB\-\-show\-op\-down\fR" 4
.IX Item "--show-op-down"
Include interfaces which are operatively down.
.IP "\fB\-\-zero\-speed\fR \fIspeed\fR" 4
.IX Item "--zero-speed speed"
Assign this speed in bits-per-second to all interfaces which return 0
for ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed.  Some switches, notably Foundry equipment,
return a speed of zero for some interfaces.  For example, to have
all interfaces reporting zero set to 100Mbps, use
\&\-\-zero\-speed=100000000.
.IP "\fB\-\-subdirs\fR \fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "--subdirs format"
Give each router its own subdirectory for the \s-1HTML\s0 and graphics (or
\&.rrd) files.  The directory name is the given \fIformat\fR string with a
couple of pattern replacements.  The string \*(L"\s-1HOSTNAME\s0\*(R" will be
replaced by the hostname of the router (however you specified it on
the \fBcfgmaker\fR commandline \*(-- it may be an actual hostname or just an
\&\s-1IP\s0 address), and \*(L"\s-1SNMPNAME\s0\*(R" will be replaced with the device's idea of
its own name (the same name that appears on the right side of the
\&\*(L"Title\*(R" lines).  For instance, a call like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& cfgmaker --subdirs=HOSTNAME__SNMPNAME public@10.10.0.18
.Ve
.Sp
would result in the generation of lines looking something like:
.Sp

This makes cfgmaker skip all steps related to interfaces which means
it will not do any polling of the router to retrieve interface
information which speeds up the execution of cfgmaker and it will
neither run any interface templates.
.IP "\fB\-\-interfaces\fR" 4

This makes cfgmaker generate configuration lines for interfaces (the
default behaviour).

The main usage of this option is to negate an \-\-nointerfaces appearing

.SH "DETAILS ON FILTERS"
.IX Header "DETAILS ON FILTERS"
The purpose of the filters is to decide which interfaces to accept and
which interfaces to reject.  This decision is done for each interface by
evaluating the filter expression as a piece of Perl code and investigating
the result of the evaluation.  If true, accept the interface otherwise
reject it.
.PP
When working with filters, remember that Perl has it's own idea of what truth
and false is.  The empty string "\*(L" and the string \*(R"0" are false, all other
strings are true.  This further imples that any integer value of 0 is
false as well as any undef value.  It also implies that all references
are considered true.
.PP
As the filter is evaluated as a Perl expression, several useful constructs
in Perl are worth mentioning:
.PP
Expressions might be grouped by using parentheses \*(L"()\*(R".  Expressions might
be combined using boolean operators such as the following:
.ie n .IP """\fBand\fR"" (equivalent with ""\fB&&\fR"")" 4
.el .IP "``\fBand\fR'' (equivalent with ``\fB&&\fR'')" 4
.IX Item """and (equivalent with &&"")"
Boolean \*(L"and\*(R" of the two expressions, is only true if both expressions are
true.  Example: \fIexpression1\fR \fBand\fR \fIexpression2\fR
.ie n .IP """\fBor\fR"" (equivalent with ""\fB||\fR"")" 4
.el .IP "``\fBor\fR'' (equivalent with ``\fB||\fR'')" 4
.IX Item """or (equivalent with ||"")"
Boolean \*(L"or\*(R" of the two expressions, is true if either or both expressions
are true.  Example: \fIexpression1\fR \fBor\fR \fIexpression2\fR
.ie n .IP """\fBnot\fR"" (equivalent with ""\fB!\fR"")" 4
.el .IP "``\fBnot\fR'' (equivalent with ``\fB!\fR'')" 4
.IX Item """not (equivalent with !"")"
Boolean negation of a single expression.  Example:  \fBnot\fR \fIexpression\fR .
Yet another example: \fB!\fR\fIexpression\fR
.PP

.Sh "Predefined Filter Variables"
.IX Subsection "Predefined Filter Variables"
To facilitate, there are a number of predefined values available to use
in the filter.  Note that these variables are also available when templates
interfaces are evaluated (but not host templates).
.PP
Caveat:  All these variables' names begin with a dollar sign  ($), which
is a syntactic requirement for scalar variables in Perl.  The danger here
is that the dollar sign in many shells is an active character (often
used for shell variables exactly as in Perl variables) so it is important
to ensure that the Perl expression isn't evaluated by the command line
shell as shell code before being passed to cfgmaker as command line
arguments.  In shells like Bourne shell, ksh shell or bash shell, placing
the entire expression within single qoutes will avoid such accidental
evaluation:
.PP

This is an integer specifying the interface type as
per the \s-1SNMP\s0 standards and as reported by the polled device.  A complete list
of interface types would be impractical for this document , but there are
a number predefined varables below.  Normally, cfgmaker puts in the target's
PageTop this iftype value within paranthesis after the name of the interface
type. (e.g \*(L"propPointToPointSerial (22)\*(R").

As quite a few of the predefined variables has values which are are supposed
to be used in \s-1HTML\s0 code some of them have an \*(L"HTML\-escaped\*(R" variant, e.g
\&\f(CW$html_syslocation\fR is the \s-1HTML\s0 escaped variant of \f(CW$syslocation\fR.  The \s-1HTML\s0
escaping means that the chars \*(L"<\*(R", \*(L">\*(R" and \*(L"&\*(R" are replaced by \*(L"&lt;\*(R",
\&\*(L"&gt;\*(R" and \*(L"&amp;\*(R" and that newlines embedded in the string are prepended
with \*(L"<\s-1BR\s0>\*(R" and appended with a space character (if a newline is last in the
string it is not touched).
.Sh "Writable Template Variables"
.IX Subsection "Writable Template Variables"
These are the variables available to store the configuration lines in.
Some of them are initialized prior to the evaluation of the template but
such content normally is comments for inclusion in the final configuration
file so those variables might be reset to the empty string in the template
code to eliminate the comments.  The other way around is also possible, the
contents of these variables might be extended with further information
for various reasons such as debugging etc.
.PP
Once the template has been evaluated, the following happens:  if the
template is a interface template and the actual interface for some reason
is rejected and thus needs to be commented out, all the lines in the
variable \fB$target_lines\fR are turned into comments by adding a hash mark
(\*(L"#\*(R") at their beginning.  Then all the variables \fB$head_lines\fR,
\&\fB$problem_lines\fR , \fB$target_lines\fR and \fB$separator_lines\fR
are concatenated together to form the lines to add to the configuration file.
.IP "\fB$target_lines\fR" 4
.IX Item "$target_lines"
This variable is the placeholder for the configuration lines created
by the template.  \fB$target_lines\fR is predefined to be empty when
the template code is evaluated.
.IP "\fB$head_lines\fR" 4
.IX Item "$head_lines"
This variable is intended to be the placeholder for the comment line
appearing just before the target in the configuration file.  It is
initialized with that comment line before the evaluation of the template
code and if the template doesn't modify \fB$head_lines\fR during evaluation,
the comment will look like usual in the config file.
.IP "\fB$problem_lines\fR" 4
.IX Item "$problem_lines"
This variable is intended to be the placholder for the comment lines
describing any problems which might have been encountered when trying
to add the target into the configuration.  For host templates it's
normally not used and for those it's predefined as the empty string.
For interface templates \fB$problem_lines\fR is predefined with
the error description comments which cfgmaker normally would use for
rejected interfaces or as the empty string for accepted interfaces.
.Sp
It is possible to test against \fB$problem_lines\fR to find out if
an interface will be included or rejected but this is not recommended.
Test against \fB$if_ok\fR instead.
.IP "\fB$separator_lines\fR" 4
.IX Item "$separator_lines"
This variable is the placeholder for the string to use as the separator
between the code for individual targets.  The contents of this variable
is put after each target (so the lines will appear after the end of the
last target in the config as well).

By default cfgmaker uses the following directives for each target it
generates: Target[], SetEnv[], MaxBytes[], Title[], PageTop[] and if
there is any directory specified also the Directory[] directive.

To facilitate the creation of templates which generates target configs
which are similar to the default one, each of the above mentioned
directive lines have a corresponding variable containing the line as
cfgmaker would have output it by default.

Example 1 was partly intended to demonstrate how to customize the generation
of interface targets but also to provide a hint of how the variables are
used in the \*(L"default\*(R" template which one could consider that cfgmaker
normally uses.

If you're only intrested in the easiest way of entirely eliminating those
reject interfaces, the template below would do the job as well by using

The first example creates a config file for \fIrouter.place.xyz\fR:  the router           
has the community name \fIpublic\fR.  Interfaces get identified by their             
\&\s-1IP\s0 number.  Two global options get added to the config file.  The                 
config file gets redirected to \fImrtg.conf\fR.  The '\e' signs at the end            
of the line mean that this command should be written on a single line.

Note: if cfgmaker is not in your path, but you are in the directory where
cfgmaker is stored, you can start it with ./cfgmaker 
.PP
The next example creates a config file for four devices:
\&\fIrouter1.place.xyz\fR, \fIrouter2.place.xyz\fR, \fIswitch1.place.xyz\fR and
\&\fIswitch2.place.xyz\fR all with the community \fIpublic\fR.
.PP
The two routers will have \fB\-\-ifref\fR set to \fBdescr\fR whilst the two
switches will use \fB\-\-ifref\fR set to \fBname\fR.  Further the routers will
use \fB\-\-ifdesc\fR set to \fBalias\fR and \fIswitch1.place.xyz\fR will use
\&\fB\-\-ifdesc\fR set to \fBdescr\fR whilst \fIswitch2.place.xyz\fR use \fBname\fR instead.
.PP
Finally, there will be two Options lines inserted in the configuration:
One will be in the beginning, whilst the other will be inserted after
the lines related to the two routers but before those lines related
to the switches.

The next example demonstrates how to use the \fB\-\-community\fR,
\&\fB\-\-snmp\-options\fR and \fB\-\-dns\-domain\fR to make the command line
simpler.  All the equipment will use the community \fIhidden\fR, except for
the ppp-server which use community \fIaccess\fR.  All equipment uses these
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 options: \fB1s timeout\fR, \fB1 retry\fR and \fB\s-1SNMP\s0 version 2\fR (\fBbackoff\fR and
\&\fBport\fR is unspecified which means they use the default values).
The exception again is the ppp-server which uses \fB\s-1SNMP\s0 version 1\fR.
Finally, all the equipment is part of the domain \fIplace.xyz\fR, except
for the ppp-server which is part of the domain \fIremote.place.xyz\fR.
Note that the latter is achieved simply by specifying the name
of the ppp-server to be \fIppp\-server.\f(BIremote\fI\fR .
