OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This File Contains a collection of interesting MIB Entries
       ...  mrtg knows about their names ... depending on the
       ASN.1 Syntax you may have to put ggaauuggee into the OOppttiioonnss[[]]::
       parameter.

       For information about how to create a TTaarrggeett[[]]:: parameter
       which references these MIB entries, please consult mrtg-
       reference.

        Enumeration:           up 1, down 2, testing 3

       The current operational state of the interface.  The _t_e_s_t_-
       _i_n_g(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be
       passed.

       The current administrative state of the interface.  The
       _t_e_s_t_i_n_g(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
       be passed.

        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The number of subnetwork-unicast packets delivered to a
       higher-layer protocol.

       iiffIInnNNUUccaassttPPkkttss

        Descriptor:            ifInNUcastPkts
        Identifier:            1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12
        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The number of non-unicast (i.e., subnetwork- broadcast or
       subnetwork-multicast) packets delivered to a higher-layer
       protocol.

       iiffIInnDDiissccaarrddss

        Descriptor:            ifInDiscards
        Identifier:            1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13
        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be dis-
       carded even though no errors had been detected to prevent
       their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.  One
       possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to
       free up buffer space.

       tax:       Counter32

       The number of inbound packets that contained errors pre-
       venting them from being deliverable to a higher-layer pro-
       tocol.

       tax:       Counter32

       The number of packets received via the interface which
       were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported proto-
       col.

       iiffOOuuttOOcctteettss

       Descriptor:             ifOutOctets Identi-

       tax:       Counter32

       The total number of octets transmitted out of the inter-
       face, including framing characters.

        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
       requested be transmitted to a subnetwork-unicast address,
       including those that were discarded or not sent.

        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
       requested be transmitted to a non- unicast (i.e., a sub-
       network-broadcast or subnetwork-multicast) address,
       including those that were discarded or not sent.




       iiffOOuuttDDiissccaarrddss

        Descriptor:             ifOutDiscards

        ASN.1 Syntax:          Counter32

       The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be
       discarded even though no errors had been detected to pre-
       vent their being transmitted.  One possible reason for
       discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.

       iiffOOuuttEErrrroorrss

        Descriptor:             ifOutErrors

       ted because of errors.

        Identifier:            1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21
        ASN.1 Syntax:          Unsigned32

       The length of the output packet queue (in packets).

       From: Simon Ferrett <simonf@world.net>

        'frInOctets' => '1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.9'
        'frOutOctets' => '1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.7'

       which when used in the form:

        frInOctets.pp.dd&frOutOctets.pp.dd:community@cisco.router

       where pp is the physical port that the frame relay pvc is
       defined on and dd is the DLCI of the pvc gets you the in
       and out octets for just that pvc.

       The return values of ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus are
       not very usefull for graphing. Use ifOperHack and ifAdmin-
       Hack instead. They return 1 for UP and 0 otherwise.

       Note these are not real MIB entities but mrtg hacks

       PPsseeuuddooZZeerroo aanndd PPsseeuuddooOOnnee

       will return 0 and 1 respectively

       Note these are not real MIB entities but mrtg hacks
