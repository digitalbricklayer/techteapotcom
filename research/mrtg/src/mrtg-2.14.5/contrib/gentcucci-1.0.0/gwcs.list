#   tc1.i40			Access Server
#   Coshocton 1			Title for device
#   48				Maximum (red line) users possible per T1 count
#   336				Absolute maxmimum possible number of users

#   tc3.i40+tc5.i40		Access Servers
#   Coshocton Total (w/o Omni)	Title for device
#   48				Maximum (red line) users possible per T1 count
#   336				Absolute maxmimum possible number of users
#
# Note: Absolute maximum is the highest potential number of users who can be
#       on-line on a particular chassis (HARC) at one time, which is not the
#       same as the number of channels plugged in to the chassis.  Absolute
#       maximum is used in the event that someone forgets to reconfigure this
#       file before adding additional capacity.  At present, one HARC can
#       handle up to approximately 336 users.  If a chassis has 3 PRI's
#       plugged into it, then 69:336 would be appropriate because each PRI
#       will provide 23 channels for users, but the HARC can still handle a
#       lot more than that.
