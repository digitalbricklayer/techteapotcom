It wakes up at 23:54 every night and copies all the current daily gifs
for the given list of routers to a directory named with the current date
(e.g. 970717). The Perl code is extremely straightforward so there
should be no problem in understanding it.

The cron entry I use is:
54 23 * * * /usr/local/lib/mrtg-2.2/backup.pl 1>>
/usr/local/lib/mrtg-2.2/backup.log 2>&1

I'll be very happy to discuss any possible improvement or modification.

Ciao

Subject: mrtg-archiver


I have made some revisions to mrtg-archiver for use at my site. In the
hopes that those changes will help others, I have appended my version.

Changes include:
Weekly archiving of week gifs, monthly archiving of month gifs, yearly
archiving of year gifs. 
Specification of which interfaces you want summary files saved for.
Terse error messages. (I happen to prefer shorter messages, to each their
own :-) )
Creation of the archive directory if it doesn't exist.
Symlinking of the mrtg gifs instead of copying (I have limited disk space)

How far would Moses have gone if he had taken a poll in Egypt? What would
Jesus Christ have preached if he had taken a poll in the land of Israel?
What would have happened to the Reformation if Martin Luther had taken a
poll? It isn't polls or public opinion of the moment that counts. It is
right and wrong and leadership.
