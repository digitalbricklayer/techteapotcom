I have enjoyed using your MRTG program to accomplish my tasks. Thank you
for a wonderful toolbox.

Attached to this document is a perl program called switchmaker which
will simply make an mrtg config file for a Cisco Catylst 5XXX switch.
Unfortunatly, I had to use the SNMP-Util-1.6 and SNMP-1.8 libraries
because I had trouble getting the libraries distrubuted with 2.7.2 to
work correctly with my code--more of an inadequacy on my part. But,
providing you have those libraries or are willing to port it, it does
work very well. At any rate it does document the MIBS you need to know
to get the correct port information out of the switch...

Enjoy.
