Investigate integration with terminal server software. such as the RADIUS 
server.

The current release of mrtg-dynip, mrtg-dynip-0.41b, appears to be stable,
robust and free of major problems arising from misconfiguration and lack of
response.

While it might seem rather trivial to introduce changes to make mrtg-dynip
more suitable as a front end to MRTG, this in a sense is somewhat trivial
in terms of the design goal of mrtg-dynip, namely to enable mrtg-dynip to
work in environments with inconsistent snmp target names for the same
phyical interface.  This design goal has been achieved.  The goal of having
a convenient and efficient 'front end' to MRTG and mrtg-dynip is a different
design goal in itself.

It is planned to investigate and test use of the 'ifLastChange' snmp object.

It is planned to introduce configuration to indicate if a host or router has
unvarying SNMP target numbers for its interfaces, or not.  Suitable coding
will reduce processing demands and reduce the amount of snmp traffic
generated.  This may be trialed with tesing use of the 'ifLastChange' snmp
object

There are plans to try out terminal server software, such as RADIUS server
software, with a RADIUS client Livingstone emulator, and see if there are
any special issues or convenient outcomes involved.

There is much scope for introducing a menu based configuration.
