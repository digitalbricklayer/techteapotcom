  It allows one to make a graph of analog/ISDN lines on a 
  Livingston Portmaster 3.   (PMLines)

* fixed a longstanding bug where rateup was skewing at log entries not
  aligned with the normal sampling interval. This happened when ever

  ... thanks to  Lane Patterson of GlobalCenter ISI <lane@isi.net>,
  Erwin Authried <eauth@softsys.co.at> and Ari Lewitter <ajl@NewsAlert.com>

Added IconDir configurable, for people who want to keep the mrtg

Made the period var a double in rateup.c as suggested by Dave

now it will try to figure the speed of an interface ....

Stooped mrtg from aborting on non existing HOST names

Warn on Duplicate CFG entries.

Customizable week number thingy from Simon Leinen

included. From: Ulf Zimmermann <ulf@Alameda.net>

Fix for time chitter by Dave ...

new pingprobe from Peter W. Osel

relaxed parsing of keywords. ther can be a space before the 
colon .... as sugested by Samath


From mcm@unx.sas.com Tue Jun  3 07:43:38 1997

Cheanged rateup.c so that it will start scaling the graphs when the 
datarate is higher than MaxBytes, if the AbsMax value is set. Even when it
is operation in unscaled mode ...
I also changed 'indexmaker' to allow me to pass in a title, and
to support the 'Directory' option in the configuration file.

From: Jay Soffian <jay@lw.net> Wed, 04 Jun 1997 15:34:01 -0400

Added new configurables XScale[], YScale[] to realy enlarge the graphs and not
just make their pixels larger ...

Added configurable Step[] to allow for shorter base periods different from 
5 Minutes ... But beware, this is NOT supported ... and its likely
that you will run into problems ...

Updated to latest version of SNMP_Session.pm This will work fine with 
perl5.002 and above. BUT not with perl 5.001 !!! so if you are still using 
an old version of perl, use SNMP_Session.pm-for-perl5.001


2.2
---

Added Contribution from Anthony Rumble. For gathering stats for apache
webservers and squid proxies

From: T. Pospisek <tpo@spin.ch>
SHELL scripts to get active tty(-dial-in modem-) lines localy and remotely. 
I'm using them with a cyclades board but they can be adapted at wish to
different tasks.

made graphs in indexmaker generated pages clickable ... leewm@sgp.hp.com 

added contributet script for gatherig portmaster stats 

added mrtg-blast contrib from Balthasar T. Indermuehle

made mrtg observe order of routers in cfg file .... as suggested by
Mick Ghazey <mick@lowdown.com>  

Added GetSNMPLinesUP to contrib ... from Carlos Canau <canau@dawn.EUnet.pt>
this is for monitoring Modembanks ...

mrtg.cfg-dist as suggested by Jun (John) Wu 

Added MaxBytes check ....

2.1
---

Added 100BaseVG iftyp to cfgmaker

Fixed rounding Bug in rateup.c which caused it to scale graphs with small 
values incorrectly ...

Added rdlog2 by Phillip Simonet. This tool transforms a xfig network 
map into a clickable gif with colorcoded representation of the 
current load of your network links. The information for the colorcoding
is taken from the mrtg log files.

From: "Peter W. Osel" <pwo@hl.siemens.de>
A perl script to get roundtrip delays to hosts by sending a ping 
to them. Added to contrib.

Allowed any character except @ and \s to be used in a community string ...

Fixed two instances where variables were declared twice (my($var)) 
within the same scope. Late perl5.003 versions do not like that ...
and it was wrong anyway. This happens both in SNMP_Session.pm 
and mrtg

When using the Directory option in connection with [^] a stray space gets
added to the path. This is now removed with s/\s//g ... spaces in path names
are stupid anyway.

2.0.1
-----

Fixed ascendget script
