mrtg-dynip
----------
From: John Heenan <johnhe@syd.net.au>

Mrtg-dynip is a contribution to mrtg, enabling mrtg to generate multi
interface traffic graphs for various hosts which do not provide a
consistent interface name for physical interfaces, such as in a dynamic IP
environment.


ircstats
--------
From: Matt Ramsey (MR227) mjr@geeks.org, mjr@nin.com

ircstats.pl is the simple perl script I use to monitor client
loads and such on various EFnet IRC servers.

PM3Lines
--------
From: Carlos Canau <canau@dawn.EUnet.pt>

Here's another script for contrib. It allows one to make a
graph of analog/ISDN lines on a Livingston Portmaster 3.

atmmaker
--------
From: Mark Trettin <mkt@lucent.com>

I am sending a copy of our atmmaker script that generates a cfg
for the FORE ASX switch you may add it to your contrib section.

distrib
-------
From: Philippe Simonet <sip00@vg.swissptt.ch>

'distrib' read mrtg log files and computes traffic distribution in 
  the time. It ouputs a graph with : 
    - in x the percentage of trafic utilisation (% bandwith)
    - in y how many times the utilization was reached (% time)

rdlog2
------
From: Philippe Simonet <sip00@vg.swissptt.ch>

Rdlog is a small (and primitive) tool that gives indication on network
traffic on a graphic map. It takes information from MRTG log files, and draw
a GIF file with links that have colors based on the current traffic on your
network. This small test explain how to use this tool.

mrtg-ipget
----------
From: Jim Willette <mailroom@ctec.net>

I have modified mrtgV2 to record stats based on interface ip address instead
of Interface number. It does not do all the great errorchecking and no OS
testing but it is functional for my needs.

mrtgidx
-------
From: Axel Dunkel <ad@Dunkel.de>

mrtgidx works like makeindex but the output produced looks different ...

get-active
----------
From: Russ Wright <Wright@LBL.Gov>

This will look at the $trafficDir directory for MRTG generated HTML
files, parse them and generate a listing of the most active interfaces
in a file called "active.htlm" in the same directory

ascendget
---------
From: John-David Childs <jdc@ism.net>

SHELL SCRIPT TO GET # of connected users on Ascend
use Target[router]: `ascendget`

get-multiserial
---------------
From: T. Pospisek <tpo@spin.ch>

SHELL scripts to get active tty(-dial-in modem-) lines localy and remotely. 
I'm using them with a cyclades board but they can be adapted at wish to
different tasks.

use Target[modems]: `get-multiserial`

ping-probe
----------
From: "Peter W. Osel" <pwo@hl.siemens.de>

A perl script to get roundtrip delays to hosts by sending a ping 
to them. 

rumb-stat
---------
From: Anthony Rumble <anthonyr@ce.com.au>

Heres some handy scripts to get byte stats from apache (web server) 1.1.1
and better and squid (proxy server) 1.1.1 and better.

portmaster
----------
From: Chris Johnson <admin@nantucket.net>
Subject: MRTG for portmasters

A script and config to produce Modem statistics for Livingston
Portmasters.

mrtg-blast
----------
From: "Balthasar T. Indermuehle" <bi@inside.ch>

This is a tcpblast interface available for MRTG 2.1. It works much like
the famed ping-probe, instead of ping it uses tcpblast to estimate
network bandwidth.
 
GetSNMPLinesUP
--------------
From: Carlos Canau <canau@dawn.EUnet.pt>

GetSNMPLinesUP.pl checks some SNMP  variables for a certain  value and
returns their sum  in a format used to  feed values to MRTG.

mrtgindex.cgi
-------------
From: Mick Ghazey <mick@lowdown.com>

like mrtgindex, but runs as a cgi. Thus it will not need SSIs ...

mrtg-mail
---------
From: Rachel Polanskis <r.polanskis@nepean.uws.edu.au>

plot sendmail mailstats with mrtg

mrtg-archiver
-------------
From: Emanuele Leonardi <Emanuele.Leonardi@roma1.infn.it>

It wakes up at 23:54 every night and copies all the current daily gifs
for the given list of routers to a directory named with the current date
(e.g. 970717). The Perl code is extremely straightforward so there
should be no problem in understanding it.
