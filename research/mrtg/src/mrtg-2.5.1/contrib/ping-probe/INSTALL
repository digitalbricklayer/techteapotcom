You need the following software installed on your system:

	- perl 5.003
		http://www.perl.com/perl/info/software.html
	- MRTG 2.0.1
		http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html
	- a ping program

(other versions might work, but have not been tested.)

Check the script, and adapt the path to your perl if necessary.  Put
the script mrtg-ping-probe into a place where MRTG can call it, e.g.
the your MRTG binary directory.

Edit your mrtg.cfg file to add statements for the devices you want to
ping.  See mrtg.cfg-ping for an example.  If you need to add several
targets for mrtg-ping-probe read mrtg.cfg-ping and customize
mrtg-ping-cfg to generate entries suitable for your environment.

Optionally create the documentation in the format you like best, e.g.
	make html
	make man
	make tex


There is currently no Perl module that supports pinging a host and
retrieving the round trip time, so we have to use an external program.
The script was written on Solaris 2.5/2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5/5.5.1).
mrtg-ping-probe knows about ping programs on AIX, BSD/OS, FreeBSD,
HP-UX, IRIX 6.2, Linux, Solaris 1 (aka SunOS 4), and Solaris 2.  You
might have to adapt it to your particular version of ping.

If you have to change the command line for ping and/or the regular
expression to parse the output, please send me the changes, the output
of "uname -a", and the pathname of the ping used, so I can include this
information in the next release.  If you use a non-native version of
ping, send me information about it, as well.

If you do not have a ping, you can grab a nice one from
ftp.nikhef.nl:/pub/network/.
