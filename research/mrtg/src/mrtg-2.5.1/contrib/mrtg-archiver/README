It wakes up at 23:54 every night and copies all the current daily gifs
for the given list of routers to a directory named with the current date
(e.g. 970717). The Perl code is extremely straightforward so there
should be no problem in understanding it.

The cron entry I use is:
54 23 * * * /usr/local/lib/mrtg-2.2/backup.pl 1>>
/usr/local/lib/mrtg-2.2/backup.log 2>&1

I'll be very happy to discuss any possible improvement or modification.

Ciao
