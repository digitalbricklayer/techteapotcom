The current relaese, mrtg-dynip-0.35x, appears to be stable, robust and free
of major problems arising from misconfiguration and lack of response.  

While it might seem rather trivial to introduce extra changes now, as
indicated below, to make mrtg-dynip mnore suitable as a front end to MRTG,
this in a sense is somewhat trivial in terms of the design goal of
mrtg-dynip, namely to enable mrtg-dynip to work in environments with varying
interface names.  This design goal has been achieved in a user convenient
way.  The goal of having a convenient and efficient 'front end' to MRTG and
mrtg-dynip is a different design goal in itself.

It is planned to investigate and test use of the 'ifLastChange' snmp object.

It is planned to introduce configuration to indicate if a host or router has
unvarying interface names or not, and to indicate if individual interfaces
are subject to varying interface names or not.  Suitable coding will reduce
the amount of snmp traffic generated and reduce processing demands.  This
may be trialed with tesing use of the 'ifLastChange' snmp object

There is much scope for introducing a menu based configuration.
