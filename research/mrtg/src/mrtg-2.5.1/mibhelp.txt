Table of Known OIDS

This File Contains a collection of interesting MIB Entries ...
mrtg knows about their names ... depending on the ASN.1 Syntax,
must use Options[]: absolute to make things work ...


Descriptor:		ifOperStatus 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8 
ASN.1 Syntax:		INTEGER 
Enumeration:		up 1, down 2, testing 3 

The current operational state of the interface. 
The testing(3) state indicates that no operational 
packets can be passed. 

Descriptor:		ifAdminStatus 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7 
ASN.1 Syntax:		INTEGER 
Enumeration:		up 1, down 2, testing 3 

The current administrative state of the interface. 
The testing(3) state indicates that no operational 
packets can be passed. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInOctets 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The total number of octets received on the 
interface, including framing characters. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInUcastPkts 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of subnetwork-unicast packets 
delivered to a higher-layer protocol. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInNUcastPkts 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of non-unicast (i.e., subnetwork- 
broadcast or subnetwork-multicast) packets 
delivered to a higher-layer protocol. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInDiscards 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of inbound packets which were chosen 
to be discarded even though no errors had been 
detected to prevent their being deliverable to a 
higher-layer protocol.  One possible reason for 
discarding such a packet could be to free up 
buffer space. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInErrors 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of inbound packets that contained 
errors preventing them from being deliverable to a 
higher-layer protocol. 
 
Descriptor:		ifInUnknownProtos 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of packets received via the interface 
which were discarded because of an unknown or 
unsupported protocol. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutOctets 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The total number of octets transmitted out of the 
interface, including framing characters. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutUcastPkts 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The total number of packets that higher-level 
protocols requested be transmitted to a 
subnetwork-unicast address, including those that 
were discarded or not sent. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutNUcastPkts 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.18 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The total number of packets that higher-level 
protocols requested be transmitted to a non- 
unicast (i.e., a subnetwork-broadcast or 
subnetwork-multicast) address, including those 
that were discarded or not sent. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutDiscards 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of outbound packets which were chosen 
to be discarded even though no errors had been 
detected to prevent their being transmitted.  One 
possible reason for discarding such a packet could 
be to free up buffer space. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutErrors 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Counter32 
 
The number of outbound packets that could not be 
transmitted because of errors. 
 
Descriptor:		ifOutQLen 
Identifier:		1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21 
ASN.1 Syntax:		Unsigned32 
 
The length of the output packet queue (in 
packets).

    'frInOctets' => '1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.9'
    'frOutOctets' => '1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.7'

which when used in the form:

frInOctets.pp.dd&frOutOctets.pp.dd:community@cisco.router

where pp is the physical port that the frame relay pvc is
defined on and dd is the DLCI of the pvc gets you the in
and out octets for just that pvc.

The return values of ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus are not very usefull 
for graphing. Use ifOperHack and ifAdminHack instead. They return 1 for 
UP and 0 otherwise.

Your Mib.hlp file is nice, but I have found a few more OIDs which are
very useful, and your users may want to know about them.  This is a
common format I use for the config file..

# My additional OID's
# tcpCurrEstab/tcpAttemptFails 
Target[machine.1]: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.9.0&1.3.6.1.2.1.6.7.0:public@machine.machine.com
MaxBytes[machine.1]: 1250000
Options[machine.1]: growright
Title[machine.1]: machine.machine.com
PageTop[machine.1]: <H1>Traffic Analysis for machine</H1>
 <TABLE>
   <TR><TD>System:</TD><TD>machine.machine.com</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Maintainer:</TD><TD>me</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Interface:</TD><TD>le0 (1)</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>IP:</TD><TD>machine.machine.com (127.0.0.1)</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>Max Speed:</TD>
       <TD>512 KBytes/s </TD></TR>
  </TABLE>

A few of the OID's which are useful:
NOTE:  0 is the last number in OID's which do not require an interface
number

1.3.6.1.2.1.6.9.0		Current TCP sessions
1.3.6.1.2.1.6.7.0		Number of tcp connection failures

1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15.<interface> 	Weird packets, could not identify protocol (garbage on the net)

1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11.<interface>	Number of unicast packets delivered (packets to the local machine)
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12.<interface>	Number of broadcast/multicast packets delivered (good to help cut down on broadcasts)

1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19.<interface>	Outbound packets dropped becuase of lack of buffer space (woops)
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20.<interface> 	Outbound packets that died due to errors 

1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21.<interface>	Number of packets waiting in the outbound queue (good for a server w/ high load)

1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13.<interface>	Inbound packets discarded due to lack of buffer space (woops)
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.<interface>	Inbound packets discarded due to errors

There are many other OID's as well, all of which can be obtained from a
MIB database.  A helpful MIB database browser can be found at
http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/cgi-bin/sbrowser.cgi although I dont know how
reliable or how long that source will be maintained.
