<P><B>The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a tool to monitor
the traffic load on network-links.  MRTG generates HTML pages
containing GIF images which provide a LIVE visual representation of
this traffic. Check <A HREF="http://www.ee.ethz.ch/stats/mrtg/">
http://www.ee.ethz.ch/stats/mrtg/</A> for an example.  MRTG is based
on Perl and C and works under UNIX and Windows NT. MRTG is being successfully 
used on many sites arrond the net.

<MULTICOL COLS=2><P>MRTG consists of a Perl script which uses SNMP to
read the traffic counters of your routers and a fast C program which
logs the traffic data and creates beautiful graphs representing the
traffic on the monitored network connection. These graphs are embedded
into webpages which can be viewed from any modern Web-browser</P>

<P>In addition to a detailed daily view, MRTG also creates visual
representations of the traffic seen during the last seven days, the
last four weeks and the last twelve months. This is possible because
MRTG keeps a log of all the data it has pulled from the router. This
log is automatically consolidated, so that it does not grow over time,
but still contains all the relevant data for all the traffic seen over
the last two years.  This is all performed in an efficient manner.
Therefore you can monitor 50 or more network links from any halfway
decent UNIX box.  </P>

<P>MRTG is not limited to monitoring traffic though, it is possible to
monitor any SNMP variable you choose. You can even use an
external program to gather the data which should be monitored via
MRTG. People are using MRTG, to monitor things such as System Load,
Login Sessions, Modem availability and more. MRTG even allows you to
accumulate two or more data sources into a single graph.</P>

History of MRTG
</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
    
<MULTICOL COLS=2> <P>In 1994 I was working at a site where we had one
64kbit line to the outside world. Obviously everybody was interested
in knowing how the link was performing. So I wrote a quick hack which
created a constantly updated graph on the web, showing the traffic
load on our Internet link. This eventually evolved into a rather
configurable Perl script called MRTG-1.0 which I released in spring
1995. After a few updates I left my job at DMU, to start work at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Due to lack of time I had to
put MRTG aside.  One day in January of 1996, I received email from
Dave Rand asking if I had any ideas why MRTG was so slow.  Actually I
did.  MRTG's programming was not very efficient and it was written
entirely in Perl.  After a week or so, Dave wrote back to me and said
he had tried what I had suggested for improving MRTG's speed.  Since
the changes did not help much, he had decided to rewrite the
time-critical sections of MRTG in C.  The code was attached to his
email. His tool increased the speed of MRTG by a factor of 40!  This
got me out of my 'MRTG ignorance' and I started to spend my spare time
developing of MRTG-2.</P>

<P>Soon after MRTG-2 development had begun I started to give beta
copies to interested parties. In return I got many feature patches, a
lot of user feedback and bug fixes. The product you are getting now is
the result of a wonderful collaboration of many people. I would like
to take this opportunity to thank them all. (See the files CHANGES and
CONTRIBUTORS in the MRTG distribution.)</P>

      any unknown keywords or structures. If MRTG is happy with the cfg
      file, it starts gathering traffic data from the routers you have
      specified. With this information it will then start the rateup
      tool which will
      create a logfile and a traffic graph GIF for each <B>Target</B>.
      When you start MRTG for the very first time, rateup will
      complain that it can not find any logfiles and the graphs generated
      will look rather empty.

      <P>
      Since MRTG updates it's graphs every 5 minutes, you may
      experience problems with proxy caches and local Netscape browser
      caches.  Sometimes these caches will return the old cached graphics
      instead of the real and updated versions from the webserver.
      </P>

      <P>If you are running the apache webserver, you can use the
      <B>WriteExpire</B> Keyword in the mrtg.cfg file. With this, mrtg will
      create *.meta files for each gif and html page. These files will
      contain 'Expire' headers which the Apache webserver can ship out
      together with the gif and html pages (Use to <B>MetaDir</B>
      keyword in the
      apache config file to enable this). With the information from
      the expire headers, Netscape and
      all the proxy caches will know when they have to fetch a new
      version
      of the file from your website and when they can use their cached
      version.</P>

  <LI>
      <P>Although MRTG's primary use is traffic monitoring, you can
      observe any SNMP variable you want. People are using it to
      monitor ModemBanks, ServerLoad, ErrorRates on Interfaces and
      many other things. If you are using MRTG for something other
      than traffic monitoring, please send me a short blurb to include
      here. Best would be with a sample URL and some hints about how
      you have configured MRTG ...

<P><I><B>Q:</B>I need more documentation ... </I><BR>

<B>A:</B>Make sure you have checked the files 'mrtg.cfg-dist' and
'mibhelp.txt' as well as the contributed scripts in the 'contrib'
directory of you mrtg distribution. If you need even more infos, make
sure to check the mailing list archive as well. There has also been an article about SNMP
and mrtg in a recent Linux Journal. It's author David Guerroro has made it
available on the net. Check <A HREF="http://www.mec.es/~david/papers/snmp">http://www.mec.es/~david/papers/snmp
</A>

</P>

<P><I><B>Q:</B>My perl complains about the SNMP_Session.pm library
... </I><BR>

<B>A:</B>If you are running a version of perl before 5.002 you should
use 'SNMP_Session.pm-for-perl5.001.</P>
      
<P><I><B>Q:</B>The GIFs created by MRTG look very strange. Not all the
grid lines are drawn and ... </I><BR>

<B>A:</B>Remove the *-{week,day,month,year}.gif files and start MRTG
again.  Using MRTG for the first time, you might have to do this
twice. This will also help, when you introduce new routers into the cfg
file.</P>

<P><I><B>Q:</B> What is my Community Name?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Try 'public', as this is the default Community Name.</P>

<P><I><B>Q:</B> I compiled your program and I get the following errors:
at the command line I typed <TT>./mrtg kirit.cfg</TT> and I get :</I>
<PRE>
    Can't locate Socket.pm in @INC at /SNMP_Session.pm line 27. 
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /SNMP_Session.pm line 27.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./mrtg line 356.
</PRE>
<B>A:</B> You need to get Perl5 installed properly. Socket.pm comes with
Perl5 and is an integral part of Perl5. Perl5 comes
with compiled in defaults about where it should look for its libraries (eg
Socket.pm). Type <TT>'perl -V'</TT> to see what your perl assumes ... And
get it fixed ... Eg by installing it properly.<P>
