# This PERL script will read in the a Cisco router config file
# created by the "write network" command and create a HTML index
# for it's interfaces that corresponds with MRTG.
# It sorts the output by interface type and adds descriptions,
# IP addresses, DLCI numbers, and bandwidth to the HTML.
#
# usage : ciscoindex.pl <config-file-name>
#
# Note: The HTML document will be named <hostname>.html
#       where <hostname> is whatever is in the router config.
