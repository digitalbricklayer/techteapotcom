1.  What does mrtg-dynip do?

The following is taken from the README file

Mrtg-dynip is a contribution to mrtg, enabling mrtg to generate multi
interface traffic graphs for various hosts which do not provide a
consistent interface name for physical interfaces, such as in a dynamic IP
environment.  The hosts must run snmp agents.

Generates a web index file of stats web pages.

For completeness, information about interface devices with unvarying
interface names, such as ethernet cards, can be configured to be included,
however this is not necessarily an efficient course of action. Certainly for
hosts or routers that do have consistent interface names, mrtg-dynip is not
an efficient approach to take.

1.1  Can mrtg-dynip act as a front end to MRTG for traffic graphing?

In a sense yes, but this is not ADVISABLE or necessarily efficient, see
above.  Future versions may make mrtg-dynip more suitable as a front end to
MRTG for some purposes, see the TODO file.

2.  What do I need to run mrtg-dynip?

You need the contribution to MRTG called mrtg-dynip.  Latest version
available from http://www.heenan.ironbark.id.au/mrtg-dynip.

MRTG needs to be successfully installed.  MRTG can be obtained from
http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html.  MRTG itself needs
the GD graphics library, see the MRTG package for details. 

3. What platforms does mrtg-dynip run on?

mrtg-dynip should run on all platforms MRTG runs on, including Windows NT. 
Mrtg-dynip's comments are oriented towards running on UNIX style systems.
such as Linux.  There are some comments on configuring directoy names for
Windows NT. Issues involved in differences between running Perl scripts on
UNIX systems and NT systems should be known to you, if you run run MRTG on
an NT machine. 

4. Are there special considerations to running mrtg-dynip?

Not really.  You must of course ensure mrtg-dynip is executable and can
write to directories and files it needs to when executed.

4.1 How do I make mrtg-dynip executable?

In UNIX the command 
chmod 744 mrtg-dynip
will make tghe file executable to the owner of the file

4.2 How can I ensure mrtg-dynip can write to directories and files

You need to ensure directories (and files if they exist already) have
appropriate write permissions.  This is beyond the scope of this FAQ. 
Basically if you have mrtg working, you will be able to get mrtg-dynip
working.

5. How do I prevent errors and interpret error messages?

Please see section 4 above. Set up log file generation as indicated in the
install file. With regard to starup error messages from rateup, see MRTG. 
Confirm SNMP agents are running correctly.  After a reboot I have found it
sometimes necesary to stop and restart the snmp daemon.  Changing order
around in startup file may have fixed this problem.  I have found running
mrtg-dynip manually outside its crond schedule may alter graph data,
starting anew on some.

5.1 Why doesn't my email address and web page link show?

Did you remove the comment symbol '#' in the configuration file?

5.2 I have configured everything, yet my index page does not update

The default option is to die if there are any response problems.  Try
changing the $suicidal option. Examine the log file.

5.3 Your crontab example looks really odd, please explain.

First the script gets mrtg to run on the regenerated 'mrtg-dynip.cfg' file. 
The crontab entry is designed to send any error mwessages from standard
output and error to a log file with a date and time indicator.  If you don't
do this you may end up perplexing/annoying/frightening those on the root
email distribution list (who are automatically emailed unredirected standard
output and error from cron jobs), if you run the script as user root. The
error messages can be confusing to those inexperienced with mrtg and snmp,
and can be lengthy and frequent!

6. I cannot find a solution to my problem in the docmentation and web
sites.  What support exists and is there a mailing list?

This depends on the problem.  For problems to do with mrtg there is an
active mailing list and extensive archive.  For problems specific to
mrtg-dynip please send an email to me at john@heenan.ironbark.id.au.
I will set up a mailing list if necessasry.
