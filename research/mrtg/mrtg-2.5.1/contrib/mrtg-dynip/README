Mrtg-dynip is a contribution to mrtg, enabling mrtg to generate multi
interface traffic graphs for various hosts which do not provide a
consistent interface name for physical interfaces, such as in a dynamic IP
environment.  The hosts must run snmp agents.  

Generates a web index file of stats web pages.

For completeness, information about interface devices with unvarying
interface names, such as ethernet cards, can be configured to be included,
however this is not necessarily an efficient course of action. Certainly for
hosts or routers that do have consistent interface names, mrtg-dynip is not
an efficient approach to take.

The package is oriented towards UNIX systems, there is no reason mrtg-dynip
should nor run under Windows NT, some comments are made relevant to this. 
Please note the first task under Windows NT is to ensure the UNIX new lines
are converted to DOS new lines or are readable.

If you use this please let me know.  If you would also like your site to be
linked from the mrtg-dynip web page, please let me know.
