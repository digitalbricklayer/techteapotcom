Things todo for mrtg
********************

Bugs to be fixed
----------------
* some times the sanity check does not work ... there were some
  negative numbers in Richard Bullingtons log file ...

* rateup is not really long int prove ... it has to be carefully checked
  for potential overflows, as my goal is to make it run clean with
  routers who pass up to 255*255*255*255/8 Bytes per second.

* the max values returned by rateup seem to fluctuate slightly when they
  have no reason to ... (judging from the graph they are describing)

Immediate Enhancement
---------------------

* handle UNKNOWN transfer rates better. Currently rateup assumes that the
  rate is stable if it does not know... I think it should tell it does now
  know at least if the periode of uncertainty is longer than say 30 minutes.

Future Directions for mrtg 3.x
------------------------------

* integrate with Daniel Wesemans ucsp ? Once it is finisched ?
