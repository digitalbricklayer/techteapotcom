My program, mrtgindex.cgi, is similar to indexmaker. There are
some signficant differences however.

Mrtgindex.cgi graphs update every 5 minutes.

Mrtgindex.cgi *graphs* are clickable. Indexmaker's *text* is
clickable.

Mrtgindex.cgi supports multiple config files.

Mrtgindex.cgi graphs are in the same order as targets in config
files. Indexmaker graphs are ordered alphabetically by title.

Perhaps mrtgindex.cgi will run on more servers because it doesn't
require SSI. OTOH, it requires CGI.pm. Between the two we should
have a program that works on all servers. :=)
