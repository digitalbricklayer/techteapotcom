I have tweaked the ipchainacc perl script provided in MRTG's contrib for our
own use at our LUG, and I thought the rest of the users might find my
changes helpful.

Changes:
1. Made it account BYTES instead of PACKETS, like it used to do before.
2. It now accepts (optional) two command-line arguments to make it
return results for the 2nd etc. rules in the chain, so for example,
I can insert rules into the 'acctin' and 'acctout' chains which'll match
traffic with destination and source (respectively) port set to 80, so I
could
see how much traffic passes through HTTP only.

so:
ipchainacc 1 1
should return counters of 2nd acctin and 2nd acctout rules.
