This is the message on comp.lang.perl:

>ANNOUNCE: mrtg - Network Traffic Stats on the Web
>
>MULTI ROUTER TRAFFIC GRAPHER
>============================
>Here at DMU, our Internet link is always under heavy load. Therefore
everybody is keen to know how the state of the link is.
>
>I have written a small perl script which gathers the traffic stats from our
backbone router. (the tool uses "snmpget" to read the information from the
router.)
>
>The tool the creates a daily, weekly and yearly traffic graphs and makes
them accessible trough a html document. (It uses ppmtogif to create the
graphics)
>
>If you are interested, you are welcome to download a
copy and see the output of the tool, take a look at my homepage server:
>
>http://engelberg.dmu.ac.uk
>
>The tool can be easily configured for other sites, and it can also keep stats
for several routers.
>
>If you have comments on this program please get in touch
>
>Enjoy!
