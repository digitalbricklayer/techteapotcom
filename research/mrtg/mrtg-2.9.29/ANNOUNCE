      The Multi Router Traffic Grapher 2.9.0
          by Tobias Oetiker and Dave Rand

MRTG 2.9 is the biggest change in MRTG since the release of MRTG 2.0.
So let's hear the news first:

* The rrdtool integration allows for massively increased logging
  performance.

* Routers which change their interface numbers are no problem any more. 
  MRTG can now reliably address interfaces by IP, MAC, Description,
  Name and Type. The cfgmaker tool has been rewritten from scratch and
  allows to generate configurations with any of the above mentioned
  interface addressing methods.

* Indexmaker has be rewritten from scratch, it is now much more
  flexible and fully documented.

* All the MRTG documentation has been reviewed and ported to perls
  "Plain Old Documentation (POD)" format. This allows to provide all
  documentation in text, HTML and man format. It is now all available
  on the MRTG web-site.

* Config file parsing has been optimized. This makes reading
  configuration files much faster. Especially large configuration files
  are faster by factors

* Under UNIX, mrtg can fork into several instances while querying
  routers.  This improves data acquisition performance dramatically,
  especially with slow networks.

* Graphs and webpages can be generated on the fly is mrtg is used with
  rrdtool logging. Several tools in the mrtg contrib section are
  available for this purpose.

* And there is more: MRTG has been translated into 29 languages, OS
  detection has been automated, did I mention performance, many of the
  contributed tools have been dated and a slew of new ones has been
  added, The config file reading code is now available in a documented
  library which simplifies the creation of other tools which need
  access to the mrtg cfg file.

* In total, over 200 individual changes are listed in the change log
  since the release of MRTG 2.9.29.


DESCRIPTION
===========

The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is an open-source  tool to
monitor the traffic load on network-links. MRTG generates HTML pages
containing Web Graphics which provide a LIVE visual representation of
this traffic.

Check 
   http://www.stat.ee.ethz.ch/mrtg/
to see what it does. 

MRTG consists of a Perl script which uses SNMP to read the traffic
counters of your routers and a fast C program which logs the traffic
data and creates beautiful graphs representing the traffic on the
monitored network connection. These graphs are embedded into webpages
which can be viewed from any modern Web-browser.

Mrtg is known to work on most UNIX variants as well as on NT.
