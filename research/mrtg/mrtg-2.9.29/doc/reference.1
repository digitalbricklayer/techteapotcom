.IX Title "REFERENCE 1"
.TH REFERENCE 1 "2003-04-12" "2.9.29" "mrtg"
.SH "NAME"
reference \- MRTG 2.9.29 configuration reference
.SH "OVERVIEW"
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
The runtime behaviour of \s-1MRTG\s0 is governed by a configuration file. Run\-of\-
ther-mill configuration files can be generated with \fBcfgmaker\fR. (Check
cfgmaker). But for more elaborate configurations some hand-tuning is
required.
.PP
This document describes all the configuration options understood by
the mrtg software.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 configuration file syntax follows some simple rules:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Keywords must start at the beginning of a line.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lines which follow a keyword line which start
with a blank are appended to the keyword line
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty Lines are ignored
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lines starting with a # sign are comments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
You can add other files into the configuration file using
.Sp
\&\fBInclude:\fR \fIfile\fR
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Include: base-options.inc
.Ve
.Sp
If included files are specified with relative paths, both the current
working directory and the directory containing the main config file will
be searched for the files.
.SH "GLOBAL KEYWORDS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL KEYWORDS"
.Sh "WorkDir"
.IX Subsection "WorkDir"
WorkDir specifies where the logfiles and the webpages should
be created.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& WorkDir: /usr/tardis/pub/www/stats/mrtg
.Ve
.SH "OPTIONAL GLOBAL KEYWORDS"
.IX Header "OPTIONAL GLOBAL KEYWORDS"
.Sh "HtmlDir"
.IX Subsection "HtmlDir"
HtmlDir specifies the directory where the html (or shtml,
but we'll get on to those later) lives.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Workdir overrides the settings for htmldir, imagedir
and logdir.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Htmldir: /www/mrtg/
.Ve
.Sh "ImageDir"
.IX Subsection "ImageDir"
ImageDir specifies the directory where the images live. They
should be under the html directory.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Imagedir: /www/mrtg/images
.Ve
.Sh "LogDir"
.IX Subsection "LogDir"
LogDir specifies the directory where the logs are stored.
This need not be under htmldir directive.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Logdir: /www/mrtg/logs
.Ve
.Sh "Forks (\s-1UNIX\s0 only)"
.IX Subsection "Forks (UNIX only)"
With system that supports fork (\s-1UNIX\s0 for example), mrtg can fork itself into multiple
instances while it is acquiring data via snmp.
.PP
For situations with high latency or a great number of devices
this will speed things up considerably. It will not make things faster,
though, if you query a single switch sitting next door.
.PP
As far as I know \s-1NT\s0 can not fork so this option is not available on \s-1NT\s0.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Forks: 4
.Ve
.Sh "Refresh"
.IX Subsection "Refresh"
How many seconds apart should the browser (Netscape) be
instructed to reload the page? If this is not defined, the
default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Refresh: 600
.Ve
.Sh "Interval"
.IX Subsection "Interval"
How often do you call mrtg? The default is 5 minutes. If
you call it less often, you should specify it here. 
This does two things:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The generated \s-1HTML\s0 page contains the right
information about the calling interval ...
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \s-1META\s0 header in the generated \s-1HTML\s0 page will instruct
caches about the time-to-live of this page .....
.PP
In this example, we tell mrtg that we will be calling it
every 10 minutes. If you are calling mrtg every 5
minutes, you can leave this line commented out.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Interval: 10
.Ve
.PP
Note that unless you are using rrdtool you can not set Interval to less
than 5 minutes. If you are using rrdtool you can set interval down to 1
minute. Note though, setting the Interval for an rrdtool/mrtg setup will
influence the initial creation of the database. If you change the interval
later, all existing databases will remain at the resolution they were
initially created with.
.Sh "WriteExpires"
.IX Subsection "WriteExpires"
With this switch mrtg will generate .meta files for \s-1CERN\s0
and Apache servers which contain Expiration tags for the
html and gif files. The *.meta files will be created in
the same directory as the other files, so you will have
to set \*(L"MetaDir .\*(R" and \*(L"MetaFiles on\*(R"
in your apache.conf or .htaccess file for this to work
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 If you are running Apache\-1.2 or later, you can use the mod_expire
to achieve the same effect ... see the file htaccess.txt
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& WriteExpires: Yes
.Ve
.Sh "NoMib2"
.IX Subsection "NoMib2"
Normally we ask the \s-1SNMP\s0 device for 'sysUptime' and 'sysName' properties.
Some do not have these. If you want to avoid getting complaints from
mrtg about these missing properties, specify the nomib2 option.
.PP
An example of agents which do not implement base mib2 attributes are
Computer Associates \- Unicenter \s-1TNG\s0 Agents.  \s-1CA\s0 relies on using the base
\&\s-1OS\s0 \s-1SNMP\s0 agent in addition to its own agents to supplement the management
of a system.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& NoMib2: Yes
.Ve
.Sh "SingleRequest"
.IX Subsection "SingleRequest"
Some \s-1SNMP\s0 implementations can not deal with requests asking for
multiple snmp variables in one go. Set this in your cfg file to force
mrtg to only ask for one variable per request.
.PP
Examples
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SingleRequest: Yes
.Ve
.Sh "SnmpOptions"
.IX Subsection "SnmpOptions"
Apart from the per target timeout options, you can also configure the
behaviour of the snmpget process on a more profound level. SnmpOptions
accepts a hash of options. The following options are currently supported:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& timeout                   => $default_timeout,
\& retries                   => $default_retries,
\& backoff                   => $default_backoff,
\& default_max_repetitions   => $max_repetitions,
\& lenient_source_port_matching => 0,
\& lenient_source_address_matching => 1
.Ve
.PP
The values behind the options indicate the current default value.
Note that these settings \s-1OVERRIDE\s0 the per target timeout settings.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SnmpOptions: retries => 2, only_ip_address_matching => 0
.Ve
.PP
Note that \s-1AS/400\s0 snmp seems to be broken in a way which prevents mrtg from
working with it unless 
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SnmpOptions: lenient_source_port_matching => 1
.Ve
.PP
is set.
.Sh "IconDir"
.IX Subsection "IconDir"
If you want to keep the mrtg icons in someplace other than the
working (or imagedir) directory, use the \fIIconDir\fR variable for
defining the url of the icons directory.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IconDir: /mrtgicons/
.Ve
.Sh "LoadMIBs"
.IX Subsection "LoadMIBs"
Load the \s-1MIB\s0 file(s) specified and make its OIDs available as
symbolic names. For better efficiancy, a cache of MIBs is maintained
in the WorkDir.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LoadMIBs: /dept/net/mibs/netapp.mib,/usr/local/lib/ft100m.mib
.Ve
.Sh "Language"
.IX Subsection "Language"
Switch output format to the selected Language (Check the \fItranslate\fR directory
to see which languages are supported at the moment. In this directory you
can also find instructions on how to create new translations).
.PP
Currently the following laguages are supported:

.Sh "LogFormat"
.IX Subsection "LogFormat"
Setting LogFormat to 'rrdtool' in your mrtg.cfg file enables rrdtool mode.
In rrdtool mode, mrtg relies on \fBrrdtool\fR to do its logging. Graphs and html
pages will be generated on the fly by the 14all.cgi which can be found in
the contrib section together with a short readme ... This feature has been
contributed by Rainer\ Bawidamann\ <bawidama@users.sourceforge.net>. Please check his
website for more information: http://www.wh\-hms.uni\-ulm.de/~widi/14all/
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LogFormat: rrdtool
.Ve
.Sh "LibAdd"
.IX Subsection "LibAdd"
If you are using rrdtool mode and your \fBrrdtool\fR Perl module (RRDs.pm)
is not installed in a location where perl can find it on its own, you can
use LibAdd to supply an appropriate path.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LibAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/lib/perl/
.Ve
.Sh "PathAdd"
.IX Subsection "PathAdd"
If the \fBrrdtool\fR executable can not be found in the normal \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR, you can
use this keyword to add a suitable directory to your path.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& PathAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/bin/
.Ve
.Sh "RunAsDaemon"
.IX Subsection "RunAsDaemon"
The RunAsDaemon keyword enables daemon mode operation. The purpose of daemon
mode is that \s-1MRTG\s0 is launched once and not repeatedly (as it is with cron). 
This behavior saves computing resourses as loading and parsing
of configuration files happens only once.
.PP
Using daemon mode \s-1MRTG\s0 itself is responible for timing the measurement
intervals. Therfore its important to set the Interval keyword to an
apropiate value.
.PP
Note that when using daemon mode \s-1MRTG\s0 should no longer be started from cron
as each new process runs forever. Instead \s-1MRTG\s0 should be
started from the command prompt or by a system startup script.
.PP
If you want mrtg to run under a particular user and group (it is not recomended to run
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 as root) then you can use the \fB\-\-user=\fR\fIuser_name\fR and \fB\-\-group=\fR\fIgroup_name\fR
options on the mrtg commandline.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& mrtg --user=mrtg_user --group=mrtg_group mrtg.cfg
.Ve
.PP
Also note that in daemon mode restarting the process is required in order to
activate changes in the config file.
.PP
Under \s-1UNIX\s0, the Daemon switch causes mrtg to fork into background after
checking its config file. On Windows \s-1NT\s0 the \s-1MRTG\s0 process will detach from
the console, but because the \s-1NT/2000\s0 shell waits for its children you have to
use this special start sequence when you launch the program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& start /b perl mrtg mrtg.cfg
.Ve
.PP
You may have to add path information equal to what you add when you run mrtg
from the commandline.
.PP
Example
.PP
.Vb 2
\& RunAsDaemon:Yes
\& Interval:5
.Ve
.PP
This makes \s-1MRTG\s0 run as a daemon beginning data collection every 5 minutes
.SH "PER TARGET CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "PER TARGET CONFIGURATION"
Each monitoring target must be identified by a unique name. This
name must be appended to each parameter belonging to the same
target. The name will also be used for naming the
generated webpages, logfiles and images for this target.
.Sh "Target"
.IX Subsection "Target"
With the \fITarget\fR keyword you tell mrtg what it should
monitor. The \fITarget\fR keyword takes arguments in a wide
range of formats:
.IP "Basic" 4
.IX Item "Basic"
The most basic format is \*(L"port:community@router\*(R"
This will generate a traffic graph for the interface 'port'
of the host 'router' (dns name or \s-1IP\s0 address)
and it will use the community 'community' (snmp password)
for the snmp query.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: 2:public@wellfleet-fddi.ethz.ch
.Ve
.Sp
If your community contains a \*(L"@\*(R" or a \*(L" \*(R" these characters
must be escaped with a \*(L"\e\*(R".
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[bla]: 2:stu\e pi\e@d@router
.Ve
.IP "SNMPv2c" 4
.IX Item "SNMPv2c"
If you have a fast router you might want to try to poll the ifHC* counters.
This feature gets activated by switching to SNMPv2c. Unfortunately not all
devices support SNMPv2c yet. If it works, this will prevent your counters
from wraping within the 5 minute polling interval, since we now use 64 bit
instead of the normal 32 bit.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: 2:public@router1:::::2
.Ve
.IP "Reversing" 4
.IX Item "Reversing"
Sometimes you are sitting on the wrong side of the
link, and you would like to have mrtg report Incoming
traffic as Outgoing and vice versa. This can be achieved
by adding the '\-' sign in front of the \*(L"Target\*(R"
description. It flips the incoming and outgoing traffic rates.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezci]: -1:public@ezci-ether.ethz.ch
.Ve
.IP "Explicit OIDs" 4
.IX Item "Explicit OIDs"
You can also explicitly define which \s-1OID\s0 to query by using the
following syntax 'OID_1&OID_2:community@router'
The following example will retrieve error counts for input and output
on interface 1.  \s-1MRTG\s0 needs to graph two variables,
so you need to specify two \s-1OID\s0's such as temperature and humidity
or error input and error output.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.1&1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20.1:public@myrouter
.Ve
.IP "\s-1MIB\s0 Variables" 4
.IX Item "MIB Variables"
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 knows a number of symbolic \s-1SNMP\s0 variable names.
See the file mibhelp.txt for a list of known names.
One example are the ifInErrors and ifOutErrors.
This means you can specify the above as:
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: ifInErrors.1&ifOutErrors.1:public@myrouter
.Ve
.IP "Interface by \s-1IP\s0" 4
.IX Item "Interface by IP"
Sometimes \s-1SNMP\s0 interface index can change, like when new interfaces are
added or removed. This can cause all Target entries in your config file
to become offset, causing \s-1MRTG\s0 to graphs wrong instances etc.
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 supports \s-1IP\s0 address instead of ifindex in target definition. Then
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 will query snmp device and try to map \s-1IP\s0 address to the current ifindex.
You can use \s-1IP\s0 addresses in every type of target definition by adding
\&\s-1IP\s0 address of the numbered interface after \s-1OID\s0 and separation char '/'.
.Sp
Make sure that the given \s-1IP\s0 address is used on
your same target router, especially when graphing two different OIDs
and/or interface split by '&' delimiter.
.Sp
You can tell cfgmaker to generate such references with the option
\&\fB\-\-ifref=ip\fR.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& Target[ezwf]: /1.2.3.4:public@wellfleet-fddi.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezci]: -/1.2.3.4:public@ezci-ether.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezwf]: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14/1.2.3.4&1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14/1.2.3.4:public@myrouter
\& Target[ezwf]: ifInErrors/1.2.3.4&ifOutErrors/1.2.3.4:public@myrouter
.Ve
.IP "Interface by Description" 4
.IX Item "Interface by Description"
If you can not use \s-1IP\s0 addresses you might want to use
the interface names. This works similar to the \s-1IP\s0 address aproach
except that the prefix to use is a \e instead of a /
.Sp
You can tell cfgmaker to generate such references with the option
\&\fB\-\-ifref=descr\fR.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& Target[ezwf]: \eMy-Interface2:public@wellfleet-fddi.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezci]: -\eMy-Interface2:public@ezci-ether.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezwf]: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14\eMy-Interface2&1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14\eMy-Interface3:public@myrouter
\& Target[ezwf]: ifInErrors\eMy-Interface2&ifOutErrors\eMy-Interface3:public@myrouter
.Ve
.Sp
If your description contains a \*(L"&\*(R", a \*(L":\*(R", a \*(L"@\*(R" or a \*(L" \*(R" you can include
them but you must escape with a backlash:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: \efun\e: \e ney\e&ddd:public@hello.router
.Ve
.IP "Interface by Name" 4
.IX Item "Interface by Name"
This is the only sensible way to reference the interfaces of your switches.
.Sp
You can tell cfgmaker to generate such references with the option
\&\fB\-\-ifref=name\fR.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& Target[ezwf]: #2/11:public@wellfleet-fddi.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezci]: -#2/11:public@ezci-ether.ethz.ch
\& Target[ezwf]: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14#3/7&1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14#3/7:public@myrouter
\& Target[ezwf]: ifInErrors#3/7&ifOutErrors#3/7:public@myrouter
.Ve
.Sp
If your description contains a \*(L"&\*(R", a \*(L":\*(R", a \*(L"@\*(R" or a \*(L" \*(R" you can include them but you must escape with
a backlash:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: #\e: \e fun:public@hello.router
.Ve
.Sp
<Note that the # sign will be interpreted as a comment character if
it is the first non white-space character on the line.>
.IP "Interface by Ethernet Address" 4
.IX Item "Interface by Ethernet Address"
When the \s-1SNMP\s0 interface index changes, you can key that interface by its
\&'Physical Address', sometimes called a 'hard address', which is the \s-1SNMP\s0
variable 'ifPhysAddress'.  Internally, \s-1MRTG\s0 matches the Physical Address from
the *.cfg file to its current index, and then uses that index for the rest of
the session.
.Sp
You can use the Physical Address in every type of target definition by adding
the Physical Address after the \s-1OID\s0 and the separation char '!' (analogous to the \s-1IP\s0
address option).  The Physical address is specified as '\-' delimited
octets, such as \*(L"0a\-0\-f1\-5\-23\-18\*(R" (omit the double quotes). Note that some
routers use the same Hardware Ethernet Address for all of their Interfaces which
prevents unique interface identification. Mrtg will notice such problems and alert you.

You can tell cfgmaker to generate configuration files with hardware ethernet address references
by using the option \fB\-\-ifref=eth\fR.

It seems that there are devices that try to defy all monitoring efforts: the interesting interfaces have
neither ifName nor a constant ifDescr not to mention a persistant ifIndex. The only way to get a constant
mapping is by looking at the interface type, because the interface you are interested in is unique in the
device you are looking at ...

In all places where ``community@router'' is accepted, you can add
additional parameters for the \s-1SNMP\s0 communication using
colon-separated suffixes. The full syntax is as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& community@router[:[port][:[timeout][:[retries][:[backoff][:version]]]]]
.Ve
.Sp
where the meaning of each parameter is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "port" 4
.IX Item "port"
the \s-1UDP\s0 port under which to contact the \s-1SNMP\s0 agent (default: 161)
.IP "timeout" 4
.IX Item "timeout"
initial timeout for \s-1SNMP\s0 queries, in seconds (default: 2.0)
.IP "retries" 4
.IX Item "retries"
number of times a timed-out request will be retried (default: 5)
.IP "backoff" 4
.IX Item "backoff"
factor by which the timeout is multiplied on every retry (default: 1.0).
.IP "version" 4
.IX Item "version"
for \s-1SNMP\s0 version. If you have a fast router you might want to put
a '2' here. This will make mrtg try to poll the 64 bit counters and thus
prevent excessive counter wrapping. Not all routers support this though.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1

This would refer to the input/output octet counters for the interface

by the \s-1SNMP\s0 agent listening on \s-1UDP\s0 port 9161.  The standard initial

.IP "External Monitoring Scripts" 4
.IX Item "External Monitoring Scripts"
If you want to monitor something which does not provide
data via snmp you can use some external program to do
the data gathering.
.Sp
The external command must return 4 lines of output:
.RS 4
.IP "Line 1" 4
.IX Item "Line 1"
current state of the first variable, normally 'incoming bytes count'
.IP "Line 2" 4
.IX Item "Line 2"
current state of the second variable, normally 'outgoing bytes count'
.IP "Line 3" 4
.IX Item "Line 3"
string (in any human readable format), telling the uptime of the target.
.IP "Line 4" 4
.IX Item "Line 4"
string, telling the name of the target.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Depending on the type of data your script returns you
might want to use the 'gauge' or 'absolute' arguments
for the \fIOptions\fR keyword.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target[ezwf]: `/usr/local/bin/df2mrtg /dev/dsk/c0t2d0s0`

.Sp
Note the use of the backticks (`), not apostrophes (')
around the command.
.Sp
If you want to use a backtick in the command name this can be done
but you must escape it with a backslash ...
.Sp
If your script does not have any data to return but does not want mrtg to
complain about invalid data, it can return '\s-1UNKNOWN\s0' instead of a number.
Note though that only rrdtool is realy equipped to handle unknown data well.

.Sh "MaxBytes"
.IX Subsection "MaxBytes"
The maximum value either of the two variables monitored
are allowed to reach. For monitoring router traffic
this is normally the bytes per second this
interface port can carry.
.PP
If a number higher than \fIMaxBytes\fR is returned, it is ignored.
Also read the section on \fIAbsMax\fR for further info.
The \fIMaxBytes\fR value is also used in calculating the Y range
for unscaled graphs (see the section on \fIUnscaled\fR).
.PP
Since most links are rated in bits per second, you need to divide
their maximum bandwidth (in bits) by eight (8) in order to get
bytes per second.  This is very important to make your
unscaled graphs display realistic information.
T1 = 193000, 56K = 7000, Ethernet = 1250000. The \fIMaxBytes\fR
value will be used by mrtg to decide whether it got a
valid response from the router.
.PP
If you need two different MaxBytes values for the two monitored
variables, you can use MaxBytes1 and MaxBytes2 instead of MaxBytes.

.Sh "AbsMax"
.IX Subsection "AbsMax"
If you are monitoring a link which can handle more traffic
than the \fIMaxBytes\fR value. Eg, a line which uses compression
or some frame relay link, you can use the \fIAbsMax\fR keyword
to give the absolute maximum value ever to be reached.
We need to know this in order to sort out unrealistic values
returned by the routers. If you do not set \fIAbsMax\fR, rateup
will ignore values higher than \fIMaxBytes\fR.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sh "Unscaled"
.IX Subsection "Unscaled"
By default each graph is scaled vertically to make the
actual data visible even when it is much lower than
\&\fIMaxBytes\fR.  With the \fIUnscaled\fR variable you can suppress
this.  It's argument is a string, containing one letter
for each graph you don't want to be scaled: d=day w=week
m=month y=year.  There is also a special case to unset the
variable completely: n=none. This could be useful in the
event you need to override a global configuration. In the
example scaling for the yearly and the monthly graph are
suppressed.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Unscaled[ezwf]: ym
.Ve
.Sh "WithPeak"
.IX Subsection "WithPeak"
By default the graphs only contain the average
values of the monitored variables \- normally the
transfer rates for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The following option instructs mrtg to display the peak
5 minute values in the [w]eekly, [m]onthly and
[y]early graph. In the example we define the monthly
and the yearly graph to contain peak as well as average
values.
.PP
Examples:

.Ve
.Sh "Suppress"
.IX Subsection "Suppress"
By default mrtg produces 4 graphs. With this option
you can suppress the generation of selected graphs.

In this example we suppress the yearly graph
as it is quite empty in the beginning.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Sh "Extension"
.IX Subsection "Extension"
By default, mrtg creates .html files. Use this option to tell mrtg to
use a different extension. For example you could set the extension to
php3, then you will be able to enclose \s-1PHP\s0 tags into the output (useful
for getting a router name out of a database).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sh "Directory"
.IX Subsection "Directory"
By default, mrtg puts all the files that it generates for each
target (the GIFs, the \s-1HTML\s0 page, the log file, etc.) in \fIWorkDir\fR.
.PP
If the \fIDirectory\fR option is specified, the files are instead put
into a directory under \fIWorkDir\fR or Log\-, Image\- and HtmlDir).
(For example the \fIDirectory\fR
option below would cause all the files for a target ezwf
to be put into directory /usr/tardis/pub/www/stats/mrtg/ezwf/ .)
.PP
The directory must already exist; mrtg will not create it.

.Sh "Options"
.IX Subsection "Options"
The \fIOptions\fR Keyword allows you to set some boolean
switches:
.IP "growright" 4
.IX Item "growright"
The graph grows to the left by default.
This option flips the direction of growth
causing the current time to be at the right edge
of the graph and the history values to the left of it.
.IP "bits" 4
.IX Item "bits"
All the monitored variable values are multiplied by 8
(i.e. shown in bits instead of bytes) ... looks much more impressive :\-)
It also affects the 'factory default' labeling and units
for the given target.
.IP "perminute" 4
.IX Item "perminute"
All the monitored variable values are multiplied by 60
(i.e. shown in units per minute instead of units per second) in case
of small values more accurate graphs are displayed.
It also affects the 'factory default' labeling and units
for the given target.
.IP "perhour" 4
.IX Item "perhour"
All the monitored variable values are multiplied by 3600
(i.e. shown in units per hour instead of units per second) in case
of small values more accurate graphs are displayed.
It also affects the 'factory default' labeling and units
for the given target.
.IP "noinfo" 4
.IX Item "noinfo"
Suppress the information about uptime and
device name in the generated webpage.
.IP "nopercent" 4
.IX Item "nopercent"
Don't print usage percentages.
.IP "transparent" 4
.IX Item "transparent"
Make the background of the generated gifs transparent.
.IP "integer" 4
.IX Item "integer"
Print summary lines below graph as integers without commas.
.IP "dorelpercent" 4
.IX Item "dorelpercent"
The relative percentage of IN-traffic to OUT-traffic is calculated
and displayed in the graph as an additional line.
Note: Only a fixed scale is available (from 0 to 100%). Therefore
if IN-traffic is greater than OUT-traffic then 100% is displayed.
If you suspect that your IN-traffic is not always less than or equal
to your OUT-traffic you are urged to not use this options.
Note: If you use this option in combination with the \fIColours\fR
options, a fifth colour-name colour-value pair is required there.
.IP "avgpeak" 4
.IX Item "avgpeak"
There are some ISPs who use the average Peak values to bill their customers.
Using this option \s-1MRTG\s0 displays these values for each graph. The value is
built by averaging the max 5 minute traffic avarage for each 'step' shown in
the graph. For the Weekly graph this means that it builds the average of all
2 hour intervals 5 minute peak values. (Confused? Thought so!)
.IP "gauge" 4
.IX Item "gauge"
Treat the values gathered from target as 'current status' measurements
and not as ever incrementing counters.
This would be useful to monitor things like disk space,
processor load, temperature, and the like ...
.Sp
In the absence of 'gauge' or 'absolute' options,
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 treats variables as a counters and calculates
the difference between the current and the previous value
and divides that by the elapsed time between
the last two readings to get the value to be plotted.
.IP "absolute" 4
.IX Item "absolute"
This is for counter type data sources which reset their value when they are
read. This means that rateup does not have to build the difference between
the current and the last value read from the data source. The value obtained is
still divided by the elapsed time between the current and the last reading, which makes
it different from the 'gauge' option. Useful for external data gatherers.
.IP "unknaszero" 4
.IX Item "unknaszero"
Log unknown data as zero instead of the default behaviour of repeating the
last value seen. Be careful with this, often a flat line in the graph is
much more obvious than a line at 0.
.IP "withzeroes" 4
.IX Item "withzeroes"
Normally we ignore all values which are zero when calculating the average
transfer rate on a line. If this is not desirable use this option.
.IP "noborder" 4
.IX Item "noborder"
If you are using rateup to log data, \s-1MRTG\s0 will create the graph images.
Normally these images have a shaded border around them. If you do not want the
border to be drawn, enable this option. This option has no effect if you are
not using rateup.
.IP "noarrow" 4
.IX Item "noarrow"
As with the option above, this effects rateup graph generation only. Normally
rateup will generate graphs with a small arrow showing the direction of the
data. If you do not want this arrow to be drawn, enable this option. This
option has no effect if you are not using rateup.
.IP "noi" 4
.IX Item "noi"
When using rateup for graph generation, you can use this option to stop rateup
drawing a graph for the 'I' or first variable. This also removes entries for
this variable in the \s-1HTML\s0 page \s-1MRTG\s0 generates, and will remove the peaks for
this variable if they are enabled. This allows you to hide this data, or can
be very useful if you are only graphing one line of data rather than two.
This option is not destructive \- any data received for the the variable
continued to be logged, it just isn't shown.
.IP "noo" 4
.IX Item "noo"
Same as above, except relating to the 'O' or second variable.
.IP "nobanner" 4
.IX Item "nobanner"
When using rateup for graph generation, this option disables \s-1MRTG\s0 adding the
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 banner to the \s-1HTML\s0 pages it generates.
.IP "nolegend" 4
.IX Item "nolegend"
When using rateup for graph generation, this option will stop \s-1MRTG\s0 from creating
a legend at the bottom of the \s-1HTML\s0 pages it generates.

.IX Subsection "Timezone"
If you live in an international world, you might want to
generate the graphs in different timezones. This is set in the

.Sh "Weekformat"
.IX Subsection "Weekformat"
By default, mrtg (actually rateup) uses the \fIstrftime\fR\|(3) '%W' option
to format week numbers in the monthly graphs.  The exact semantics
of this format option vary between systems.  If you find that the
week numbers are wrong, and your system's \fIstrftime\fR\|(3) routine
supports it, you can try another format option.  The \s-1POSIX\s0 '%V'
option seems to correspond to a widely used week numbering
convention.  The week format character should be specified as a
single letter; either W, V, or U.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Weekformat[ezwf]: V
.Ve
.Sh "RRDRowCount"
.IX Subsection "RRDRowCount"
This affects the creation of new rrd files. By default rrds are created to
hold about 1 day's worth of high resolution data. (plus 1 week of 30 minute
data, 2 months of 2 hour data and 2 years of 1 day data).  With this Keyword
you can change the number of base interval entries configured for new rrds
as they get created. Note that you must take the interval time into account.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& RRDRowCount[ezwf]: 1600

.SH "THRESHOLD CHECKING"
.IX Header "THRESHOLD CHECKING"
Through its threshold checking functionality mrtg is able to detect
threshold problems for the various targets and can call external
scripts to handle those problems (e.g. send email or a page to an administrator).
.PP
Threshold checking is configured through the following parameters:
.Sh "ThreshDir (\s-1GLOBAL\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshDir (GLOBAL)"
By defining ThreshDir to point to a writable directory, \s-1MRTG\s0 will only alert
you when a threshold boundery has been crossed. 
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ThreshDir: /var/mrtg/thresh
.Ve
.Sh "ThreshMinI  (\s-1PER\s0 \s-1TARGET\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshMinI  (PER TARGET)"
This is the minimum acceptable value for the Input (first) parameter.  If
the parameter falls below this value, the program specified in ThreshProgI
will be run. If the value ends in '%' then the threshold is defined relative to MaxBytes.
.Sh "ThreshMaxI (\s-1PER\s0 \s-1TARGET\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshMaxI (PER TARGET)"
This is the maximum acceptable value for the Input (first) parameter.  If
the parameter falls above this value, the program specified in ThreshProgI
will be run. If the value ends in '%' then the threshold is defined relative to MaxBytes.
.Sh "ThreshDesc (\s-1PER\s0 \s-1TARGET\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshDesc (PER TARGET)"
Its value will be assigned to the environment variable \s-1THRESH_DESC\s0 before
any of the programs mentioned below are called. The programms can use the value
of this variable to produce more user-friendly output.
.Sh "ThreshProgI  (\s-1PER\s0 \s-1TARGET\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshProgI  (PER TARGET)"
This defines a program to be run if ThreshMinI or ThreshMaxI is broken. 
\&\s-1MRTG\s0 passes 3 arguments: the \f(CW$router\fR variable, the threshold value
broken, and the current parameter value.
.Sh "ThreshProgOKI  (\s-1PER\s0 \s-1TARGET\s0)"
.IX Subsection "ThreshProgOKI  (PER TARGET)"
This defines a program to be run if the parameter is currently \s-1OK\s0 (based on
ThreshMinI and ThreshMaxI), but wasn't \s-1OK\s0 on the previous running \*(-- based
on the files found in ThreshDir. \s-1MRTG\s0 passes 3 arguments: the \f(CW$router\fR
variable the unbroken threshold value, and the current parameter value.
.Sh "ThreshMinO, ThreshMaxO, ThreshProgO, and ThreshProgOKO"
.IX Subsection "ThreshMinO, ThreshMaxO, ThreshProgO, and ThreshProgOKO"
These work the same as their *I counterparts, except on the Output (second)
parameter.
.PP
\&\fINote that you can use the SetEnv parameter explained above to pass
additional information to the threshold programs.\fR
.Sh "SetEnv"
.IX Subsection "SetEnv"
When calling threshold scripts from within your cfg file you might want to
pass some data on to the script. This can be done with the SetEnv
configuration option which takes a series of environment variable
assignments. Note that the quotes are mandatory. This does not
work for external scripts. It is not
possible to set environment variables per target.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& SetEnv[myrouter]:  EMAIL="contact_email@someplace.net"
\&                    HOST="www.some_server.net"
\&                    URL="http://www.some_server.net/path/mrtg.html"
.Ve
.SH "PER TARGET DEFAULT VALUES"
.IX Header "PER TARGET DEFAULT VALUES"
.Sh "Pre\- and Postfix"
.IX Subsection "Pre- and Postfix"
To save yourself some typing you can define a target
called '^'. The text of every Keyword you define for this
target will be \s-1PREPENDED\s0 to the corresponding Keyword of
all the targets defined below this line. The same goes for
a Target called '$' but its text will be \s-1APPENDED\s0.
.PP
Note that a space is inserted between the prepended text
and the Keyword value, as well as between the Keyword value
and the appended text. This works well for text-valued Keywords,
but is not very useful for other Keywords. See the \*(L"default\*(R"
target description below.
.PP
The example will make mrtg use a common header and a
common contact person in all the pages generated from
targets defined later in this file.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& PageTop[^]: <H1>NoWhere Unis Traffic Stats</H1><HR>
\& PageTop[$]: Contact Peter Norton if you have any questions<HR>
.Ve
.PP
To remove the prepend/append value, specify an empty value, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& PageTop[^]:
\& PageTop[$]:
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 With \s-1PREPEND\s0 and \s-1APPEND\s0 there is normally a space inserted between the local
value and the \s-1PRE\-\s0 or \s-1APPEND\s0 value. Sometimes this is not desirable. You can
use the \fINoSpaceChar\fR config option to define a character which can be
mentioned at the end of a $ or ^ definition in order to supress the space.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  NoSpaceChar: ~
\&  Target[^]: 1.3.6.1.4.1.482.50.2.4.20.0&1.3.6.1.4.1.482.50.2.4.21.0:get@~
\&  Target[a]: a.tolna.net
\&  Target[b]: b.tolna.net
\&  Target[c]: c.tolna.net
\&  Target[d]: d.tolna.net
.Ve
.Sh "Default Values"
.IX Subsection "Default Values"
The target name '_' specifies a default value for that
Keyword. In the absence of explicit Keyword value, the prepended
and the appended keyword value, the default value will be used.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& YSize[_]: 150
\& Options[_]: growright,bits,nopercent
\& WithPeak[_]: ymw
\& Suppress[_]: y
\& MaxBytes[_]: 1250000
.Ve
.PP
To remove the default value and return to the 'factory default',
specify an empty value, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& YLegend[_]:
.Ve
.PP
There can be several instances of setting the default/prepend/append
values in the configuration file. The later setting replaces the
previous one for the rest of the configuration file.
The default/prepend/append values used for a given
keyword/target pair are the ones that were in effect
at the point in the configuration file where the target
was mentioned for the first time.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& MaxBytes[_]: 1250000
\& Target[myrouter.somplace.edu.2]: 2:public@myrouter.somplace.edu
\& MaxBytes[_]: 8000
\& Title[myrouter.somplace.edu.2]: Traffic Analysis for myrouter.somplace.edu IF 2
.Ve
.PP
The default \fIMaxBytes\fR for the target myrouter.someplace.edu.2
in the above example will be 1250000, which was in effect
where the target name myrouter.someplace.edu.2 first appeared
in the config file.

which will send all error to the windows event log.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fRNote, there is no Message \s-1DLL\s0 for mrtg. This has the side effect
that the windows event logger will display a nice message with every entry
