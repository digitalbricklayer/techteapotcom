Attached, you find a simple script to capture iptables counter on Linux 2.4,
to use it, on each computer run iptables, add a pass line into the 
snmpd.conf to activate access like this : 

pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.2055 /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/iptables_acc_snmp

It can be useful for ISP's to make easly a main accounting and performance 
monitoring.
I provide a sample MIB file to implement it into mrtg config file.
