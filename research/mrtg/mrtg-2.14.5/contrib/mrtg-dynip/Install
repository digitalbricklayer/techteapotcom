Installation of the mrtg-dynip contribution to mrtg

This contribution to mrtg runs independently of an existing running mrtg
installation.

Only one file is necessary, mrtg-dynip.  It is necessary to have mrtg
successfully installed first and to have an snmp daemon, the snmp agent
server, running on target hosts.  See the FAQ for information on obtaining
mrtg-dynip and MRTG.

Instructions for configuring mrtg-dynip are included in the mrtg-dynip file. 
To assist with configuration, the actual configuration file used in a live
ISP is included in the mrtg-dynip-sydnet file

Ensure mrtg-dynip has executable permission (for example, run command chmod
744 mrtg-dynip) and can write to directories files it is configured to write
to.
