       mrtg-contrib - Contribution Guidelines for MRTG

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       If you have written an extension to mrtg or created a bug
       fix, please consider contributing it to the project. As I
       get quite a number of contributions every week, here are a
       few guidelines which explain how to contribute so that I
       can use the contribution without too much additional work.

       TTrraannssllaattiioonnss

       MRTG messages have been translated to a number of lan-
       guages but there are still many which have not been cov-
       ered yet. If you want to add yours, go into the
       _m_r_t_g_-_2_._1_4_._5_/_t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_e directory and follow the instruc-
       tions given in the _R_E_A_D_M_E file.

       PPaattcchheess

       When you have created your modification or extension to
       mrtg and want to submit it to me, please crate a patch for
       the files which you have modified.  Do not send entire
       files unless they are new.

       To create a patch, get hold of a copy of GNU diff (Many
       Unix systems will have this installed already. In the NT
       world you might want to get http://sources.redhat.com/cyg-
       win/ to get all the nice GNU tools available.)  and type

        diff --unified --ignore-space-change old-file new-file > simple.patch

       or if you have modified several files do

        diff --recursive --unified --ignore-space-change old-dir/ new-dir/ >long.patch

       DDooccuummeennttaattiioonn

       All documentation of mrtg is done with the perl PPOODD sys-
       tem. If you want to learn about it, type

        perldoc perlpod

       and read the instructions. If you have bugfixes or addi-
       tions to the existing documents, make sure you modify the
       PPOODD files and not the html or txt versions.

       I take documentation very seriously. Whenever you create a
       new feature for mrtg which you want to get included in the
       official release, your patch must also contain modifica-
       tions for the relevant ppoodd file in the _d_o_c tree or for the
       documentation sections of _c_f_g_m_a_k_e_r and _i_n_d_e_x_m_a_k_e_r.
