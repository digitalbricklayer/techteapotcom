1.1.x Goals
-----------

let the user define the base resolution of the graph independently of
the pixel resolution. If it is smaller than one pixel it will simply
be ignored

allow sub second presition for step definition

modularise consolidation and aquisition functions

Allow the user to define vertical scaling of graphs in a more flexible way.
some thing like --inner-range 0-1000 and --outer-range 0-10000 which means
that the grapher can choose its vertical scaling in the given range ... 
this would replace upper and lower limit

make the inclusion of G?PRINT like output in to the lables of other graph 
elements possible
