It is nice to see the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> network management community is still in rude health. Another network and systems monitoring tool has popped onto my horizon. Don't know how I missed this one, it looks a goodie!

Based upon the much underrated application server platform <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>, <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/">Zenoss</a> sure does look the part. If the website is anything to go by I can see a lot of IT and network managers finding a home for this one.

By the looks of the <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/about/team/management">board</a> they must have received a healthy dose of venture capital money. And the downloads are going thick and fast. The money tends to be a bit harder though, especially if you are relying on a support sale. That's really <strong>hard</strong>.

The idea is far from new, hell <strong><em>we</em></strong> even tried it! Although, we did have a half arsed, underfunded English style attempt. They seem to have made a good stab at it. I wish them luck. The free open source NMS space does have some very nice projects, like <a href="http://nagios.org/">Nagios</a> and <a href="http://www.opennms.org/">OpenNMS</a> as well as a raft of <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> wrappers like <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a> and <a href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/">Cricket</a>.

It does surprise me a little bit that Zenoss got VC funding. I mean, an open source company can never really build a defendable market position. All of the crown jewels are freely given away so anyone can do exactly the same thing. Still, never stopped <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> did it? Maybe I'm a bit behind on current VC thinking on the subject.
