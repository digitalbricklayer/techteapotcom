Just rung up <a href="http://www.directlineforbusiness.co.uk/">direct line for business</a> to get a quote for our compulsory <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/hse39.pdf">Employers' Liability Insurance</a> and was refused because we have dealings with companies in the USA! Weird...I'm really surprised because Direct Line is a pretty big insurer. I'd love to know what the problem is with having dealings with the USA?

Suffice it to say all of the quotes have gone up this year. ;)
