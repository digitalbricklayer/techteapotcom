We're in the process of producing a bunch of videos explaining the features on some of our more specialised products...what am I saying? They're all specialised!

There are a lot of concepts in the cabling world that many IT workers haven't come across before. We're determined to make it as easy as possible for them to learn the dark secrets of cable testing and cable locating.

The video is hosted on YouTube because it is cheap and very, very available. We haven't put a voice over on the video as yet, but being as over excitable as ever, I thought I'd jump the gun as usual.

As the recent extensive BBC website video integration has proved, all websites will be TV channels in one form or another soon, so we may as well try to be at the forefront of the trend rather than trailing behind. None of us has any experience of producing videos so it has been a steep learning curve. As usual in small companies you get to do everything with very little time and precious few resources. I guess that's probably what makes things fun!
