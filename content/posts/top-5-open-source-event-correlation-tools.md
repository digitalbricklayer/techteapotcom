Networks create lots of events. Sometimes thousands per minute.

Events can be SNMP traps generated by a server rebooting, syslog messages, Microsoft Windows event logs etc.

How do you know which events are important? The ones telling you something important?

That is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_correlation">event correlation</a> tools come in handy. You feed all of the events into the tool, as well as a description of the structure of your systems, and its job is to flag up the important ones.

If you want a survey of event correlation techniques and tools, you could do a lot worse than read Andreas MÃ¼ller's master's thesis titled <a href="ftp://ftp.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pub/students/2009-FS/MA-2009-01.pdf">Event Correlation Engine</a>. It is a few years old, but is still pretty current.
