<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at the kitchen in Microsoft&#8217;s Home of the Future. Everybody knows that nothing dates like visions of the future, but this takes the biscuit (or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focaccia">focaccia</a>, see below). I&#8217;m still waiting for my jetpack and my nuclear powered million-miles-to-the-gallon car that I was promised when I was a child, but it looks like I&#8217;ll have to wait a while yet.</p>
<p>Anyway Microsoft are going to computerise everything in the kitchen (they would wouldn&#8217;t they) and it&#8217;s the most bizarre mix of things you&#8217;ve ever heard of. In this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/home/styleandhome/2.3.27_thedigitalhomecookinginthehightechkitchen.aspx">article</a> some poor woman is gagging for a tub of mass produced, bar and RFID coded, microwaved instant soup one minute (I wonder if Microsoft will branch out into the soup kitchen market?) and the next she&#8217;s making focaccia from scratch! She can&#8217;t even spell the word!, really take a look. Just to make sure she&#8217;s wound up the computer&#8217;s talking to her all the while and projecting the recipe on top of whole lot (more likely the back of her head). And the voice appears to sound like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Steven Hawking</a> does Masterchef.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that if she can&#8217;t make a bowl of soup the bread&#8217;s going to be something to behold. Anybody fancy a Microsoft cookbook?</p>
<p>Touch screens in the kitchen are a tremendous idea. I bet poking the screen with flour covered fingers will really help readability!</p>
<p>Every detail of your family&#8217;s life is in the calendar waiting for Windows 2036pro service pack 17 to crash and lose the lot. (See how I&#8217;m doing a little bit of future gazing myself here!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m too scared to look at the rest of the house. </p>
<p>Can I make a plea to everyone? Can we please keep Microsoft out of the kitchen? I wonder if they are taking orders for jetpacks&#8230;</p>
