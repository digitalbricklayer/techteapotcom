<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get my head round what the Alarm Numbers mean in  Intellipool INM. Just when I think I&#8217;ve got it everything just slips away. </p>
<p>The idea seems to be that you can escalate Alerts. If something gets ignored you can change the Action so that a different person gets notified or a new Action gets performed. For example you can take readings from a  <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/products/temperature-monitors/index.html">Temperature Monitor</a> every minute. If a reading is too high the Alarm counter increments, eventually to the point where Alerts are sent out and Actions get performed. What the Actions are depends on what you&#8217;ve set up in the Action list and how you&#8217;ve set the Alarm Numbers. Alarms numbered 1 will be perfomed first, but if they get ignored than a new set, numbered 2 or more will get performed. It&#8217;s all very clever, but also very hard to explain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to write a document about it but I&#8217;m going to pass it by the guys before I put it up on the website, mostly I want to make sure that I&#8217;ve got it right.</p>
