Looks like <a href="http://www.rivermuse.com/">RiverMuse</a> may just be coming close to a release next week after a considerable delay (around six months) if the latest RiverMuse tweet is authoritative.

RiverMuse is supposed to be a next-generation systems management tool that just happens to be open source as well. With the people involved in RiverMuse, including such network management luminaries like Philip Tee, Predrag Mutavdzic, and Mike Silvey, we can expect big things from them.

More news when the release actually happens...
