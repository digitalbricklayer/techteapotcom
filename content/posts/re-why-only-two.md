John Willis over at <a href="http://www.johnmwillis.com/">IT Management and Cloud Blog</a> posted an <a href="http://www.johnmwillis.com/nagios/why-only-two/">interesting post</a> I'd like to reply to.
<blockquote><em>The key question is will Enterprise customers make an investment in companies like OpenNMS and Nagios with out the warm and fuzzy that Software Companies provide.</em></blockquote>
That's certainly an interesting perspective John...

It isn't that Nagios/OpenNMS aren't hitting enterprise customers. It is the nature of the sale that is different.

Nagios/OpenNMS is more of a bottom up kinda sell. Network technicians use the projects without telling the higher ups and hopefully they can spring for consultancy and training later on after they've derived value from it.

The "<strong>mighty two</strong>" (Zenoss/Hyperic) sell in a more traditional "enterprise" way by going through the CIO and getting a "<strong>Big 4 lite</strong>" sale.
<blockquote><em>As impressive as OpenNMS, and Nagios have been bootstrapping themselves it is extremely difficult for them to compete at the enterprise level without the same kind of funding that Hyperic and Zenoss have.</em></blockquote>
Ultimately, If you are right, then the "<strong>mighty two</strong>" products should be substantially better, more feature rich than Nagios/OpenNMS.

What features in the "mighty two" aren't available in Nagios/OpenNMS?
