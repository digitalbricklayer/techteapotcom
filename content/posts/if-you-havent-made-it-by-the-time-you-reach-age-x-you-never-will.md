I forget where I read that, but for a while it made me very unhappy. I was approaching X at the time and I most certainly had not "<em>made it</em>".

Still haven't.

Probably never will by my definition when aged X. And you know, it doesn't bother me one bit now.

One of the nicer things about getting older is that your definition of "<em>making it</em>" changes. In my twenties it was about money for the most part. But, it is hard not to be sucked into thinking about your position at work.

There's a lot of status tied up with managing people.

It does show the dangers of reading all of those articles on the web pontificating about success. It is your success, you get to define precisely what it is. Don't let anybody else define it for you.
