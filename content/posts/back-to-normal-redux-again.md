Apologies for the downtime over the last day or so. What started as a small hard disk failure turned into a much larger problem when the remaining disk started having intermittent errors and the server itself collapsed too. Fortunately, we are paranoid enough to take our own backups in addition to the ISP backups. Good job we did!

The images on the blog, from 30 November onwards, are missing because we didn't have the bandwidth to back them up. I've got them on my machine so I will be restoring those throughout the rest of the day.

Any emails sent during business hours yesterday are either lost or bounced. Things have been live again from 5-6pm yesterday (Tuesday).

Email subscribers may have been a little bemused to receive a whole raft of posts from November. My apologies. Things will soon be back to normal.

<strong>Update</strong>: Things were back to normal until the ISP decided to restore their backups over our backup. Stopping the web, email and database servers in the process. Things really are back to normal now. I think we've pretty well exhausted all of the things that can go wrong!

<strong>Update 2</strong>: Well, I think I spoke a little bit too soon. Things weren't completely back to normal. Though I sure hope they are now. We ran out of disk space on our system partition. I'm not going to say that we exhausted all of the things that can go wrong though this time...because we so patently didn't do the last time. Should make a good blog post tomorrow. I've had a belly full of computers today. :)
