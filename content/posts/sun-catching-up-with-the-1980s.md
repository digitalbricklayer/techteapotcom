Sun has been around since the dawn of time in IT terms, is heavily into the enterprise market, you would have thought that a major presence in the relational database market would be acquisition #1.

Still, they've got there in the end. MySQL, as the predominant open source database, ties nicely into Sun's re-branding as an open source oriented enterprise company.
