Want a home server but don't want the electric bills that come from leaving a high powered machine on all of the time? Help is at hand.

The <a href="http://www.fit-pc.com/">fit-PC</a> is a miniature, noiseless, extremely power efficient PC capable of running either Windows XP or Linux. And there's built in WiFi too.

Make a great small, inexpensive network management server too! :)
