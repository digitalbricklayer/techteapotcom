Just where the heck are Microsoft on the cloud computing thing? Ten years ago they wouldn't have given their competitors years head start in a market without a response.

Microsoft's really are going to be IBM. Are they going to be the 60s IBM or the 80s IBM. At the moment it's looking like 80s IBM.

You would have thought that, of anybody out there, Microsoft would be in as good a position as anyone.

They've got the .NET framework, web server, database, server OS, programmer eye balls, virtualisation software, development tools all they need to do is package it up and dump it under their live brand and bob's your uncle.

Weird how they are having rings run around them by a book seller. :)
