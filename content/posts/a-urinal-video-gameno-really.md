Great find by <a href="http://www.knowing.net/">Larry O'Brien</a>, a game to play whilst you're urinating. I wonder if it is multi-player?

I just can't imagine springing out of bed on a morning to go program a urinal game. They must have had industrial quantities of water around for the developers to drink!
