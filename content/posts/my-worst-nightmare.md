Every IT person I've ever met has at least one nightmare story about being roped into fixing somebody's home PC/network/broadband and everything going wrong.

A friend roped me into fixing his friend's Windows 95 PC that his kids had managed to kill by installing all manner of junk onto it. Naturally, as soon as I had fixed it, I was on point duty from then on. <strong>If the PC merely hiccuped I was expected to drop everything and hurry round to fix it</strong>. Eventually, I went round after the PC went wrong again, and the friend of a friend had one of his mates round. He was completely out of it and <strong>throughout my stay repeatedly threatened to beat me up</strong>. My host didn't do anything to stop him either. Suffice it to say, I never went back and swore that I wouldn't do anything like it again for anybody but direct family members.

<strong>It never ceases to amaze me how much complete strangers expect from IT people</strong>. Consequently, a lot of IT people lie about what they do when they meet new people.

What's your story? If you work in IT you've gotta have one. ;) Better yet, do you have a strategy that doesn't piss people off too much?
