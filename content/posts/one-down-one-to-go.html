<p>I hope nobody noticed but we had some infrastructure changes over the weekend ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>We scrapped one of our servers. Yippee! Not only does this save us a lot of money each month, it also means that we don&#8217;t have to endlessly patch the old server either.</p>
<p>Over the weekend the mail server was redirected to our new server and a number of websites too. Everything went well save for a minor snafu with a couple of parked domains. All was fixed on Monday morning.</p>
<p>One nice side effect is that we may finally have slain our spam woes&#8230;fingers crossed! We were getting hundreds of spam emails per day. Now, things are much more manageable. The new server has a lot more juice than the old one so we can run a decent set of spam rules through <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>. On the old server we could only run a very small rule set because the server just couldn&#8217;t cope with more.</p>
