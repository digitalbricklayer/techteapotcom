One of the side effects of the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/information/announcements/datacenter.php">recent RackSpace outage in their Dallas/Fort Worth data centre</a> has been finding out just how quickly their data centre heats up when the air conditioning system fails.

<blockquote>Our backup generators kicked in instantaneously, but the transfer to backup power triggered the chillers to stop cycling and then to begin cycling back up again a process that would take on average 30 minutes. <strong>Those additional 30 minutes without chillers meant temperatures would rise to levels that could result in data loss and irreparably damage customers' servers and devices</strong>. We made the decision to gradually pull servers offline before that would happen.</blockquote>

WOW! 30 minutes from air-con failure until temperatures reach a level when servers start being damaged. I knew the temperatures would go up fast, but I didn't think they'd heat up <em>that</em> fast.
