Protocol analysers are difficult tools to master. Though, once mastered you'll see the pay-off in increased productivity for the rest of your career. Many technologies come and go, but the fundamentals of how networks work changes slowly.

You can <a href="http://techteapot.com/practical-packet-analysis-book/">slug it out with books</a> but structured learning will help speed things along.

If self paced learning suits you best, a series of four self study courses are available:

<ul>
	<li>Wireshark Functionality and Fundamentals</li>
	<li>TCP/IP Network Analysis</li>
	<li>Troubleshooting Network Performance</li>
	<li>Wireshark Network Forensics and Security</li>
</ul>

If you prefer face to face, instructor led learning, that's available too from the <a href="http://www.wiresharktraining.com/index.html">Wireshark Bootcamp</a>. Courses are scheduled worldwide including the London, Munich, Netherlands &amp; Sweden. Courses are scheduled for October so get your skates on! :)
