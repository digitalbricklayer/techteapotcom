Thanks to Ken @ Ingenity for suggesting the <a href="http://www.brocade.com/launch/vyatta/">Vyatta open source router</a>. Only question mark is whether it works "out of the box" in the UK? Comes in both software only form and as a pre-built appliance.

Others on the eval list are the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090629025101/http://www.draytek.co.uk:80/products/vigor2800.html">DrayTek Vigor 2800</a> and Firebrick 105.

One major requirement is that it must, under no circumstances, have wireless capability. We need to be PCI DSS compliant because we handle credit cards and having wireless just isn't worth the hassle of all of the extra security we'd have to put in.

Any info on other routers I should be looking at?
