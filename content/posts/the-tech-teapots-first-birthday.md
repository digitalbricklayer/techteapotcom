The Tech Teapot, or as it was originally called, the OPENXTRA Blog is one year old today. Ten categories, 186 posts, 156 comments &amp; trackbacks and more tags than I care to count and we're still going strong.

I'd better mention my OPENXTRA colleagues too (they <em>do</em> read this!). :)

One thing I've learnt over the last year...blogging isn't as easy as some people make it look! Writing a good post takes far more time than I would have believed a year ago.
