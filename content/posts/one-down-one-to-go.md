I hope nobody noticed but we had some infrastructure changes over the weekend :)

We scrapped one of our servers. Yippee! Not only does this save us a lot of money each month, it also means that we don't have to endlessly patch the old server either.

Over the weekend the mail server was redirected to our new server and a number of websites too. Everything went well save for a minor snafu with a couple of parked domains. All was fixed on Monday morning.

One nice side effect is that we may finally have slain our spam woes...fingers crossed! We were getting hundreds of spam emails per day. Now, things are much more manageable. The new server has a lot more juice than the old one so we can run a decent set of spam rules through <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>. On the old server we could only run a very small rule set because the server just couldn't cope with more.

We will be moving some more sites over next weekend. Hopefully, they will go smoothly so you won't notice anything.
