Ethan Galstad, the Nagios founder, has <a href="http://community.nagios.org/2009/05/11/nagios-a-fork-in-the-road/">responded to recent criticisms of Nagios and to the recent ICINGA fork</a>. It does seem a little ironic that, although the ICINGA founders claim one of the drivers behind the fork was a lack of communication, Ethan Galstad claims they didn't communicate their disatisfaction to him.
