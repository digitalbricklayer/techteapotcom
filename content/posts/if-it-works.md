...it's not AI.

Funny. :)

Just ran across a great paper written by Eve Phillips <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130509190108/http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/~r.f.moeller/symbolics-info/ai-business.pdf">documenting a history of artificial intelligence</a>. Well worth a read. The title made me smile because my first job in IT, all the way back to 1989, was writing an expert system and it <em>most</em> certainly did <em>not</em> work.

The above paper reference came from Dan Weinreb's post Why Did Symbolics Fail?
<blockquote><em>If you ever want to start a company, you can learn a lot from reading war stories like the ones herein.</em></blockquote>
Alleluia to that, brother...or even if you just want to be a better engineer.

<strong>Update August 2013</strong>: unfortunately Dan Weinreb's blog has gone and with it the link to the article. The closest I've managed to find is this link on John Wiseman's blog.

<strong>Update December 2013</strong>: now John Wiseman's blog has gone. I think the internet is conspiring against me.
