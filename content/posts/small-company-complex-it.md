I was daydreaming today and I wondered just how many files actually make up the openxtra website. For a small site you would assume that wouldn’t be many?

Well, I’ve counted and I got quite a shock. The website is made up of 4974 files. And that doesn’t count the databases. There are three of those.

It just goes to show that things grow organically and before you know it you’ve got yourself quite a headache. Changing the website is not something we do lightly.

Just because you’re a small company doesn’t mean that your IT usage is going to be simple. Even small companies can have quite sophisticated IT systems.

And the website is only going to keep on growing...we’ve got some great plans for it in 2007 😉
