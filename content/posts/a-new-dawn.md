The Tech Teapot first started in late 2006. It wasn't called that then, it started out as the blog for [OPENXTRA Ltd.](https://www.openxtra.co.uk/), a company I co-founded all the way back in 2003.

Latterly, I kinda assumed that The Tech Teapot was dead. In fact, I dumped the wordpress site out to static files so I couldn't really modify it even if I wished to.

Still, here we are in 2020 and I have ported the content over to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is a static site generator in a similar style to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
