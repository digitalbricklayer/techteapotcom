Manufacturers of IT equipment usually specify recommended operating temperatures for their equipment. The temperature range is usually quite wide. For instance, the temperature range specified for our Dell servers is <span class="para">10Â° to 35Â°C (50Â° to 95Â°F).</span>

Given the wide operating temperature range, why can't we run our servers at a sizzling <span class="para">34.9Â°C?</span>

It is odd that Dell don't nuance the environmental information they specify. They don't say what level of system reliability you can expect at a given temperature.

The more information manufacturers provide, the better you will be able to define a suitable temperature for your server room.
