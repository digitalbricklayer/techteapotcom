Hey Mahalo, your Firefox integrated search is broken. Look at the images...<a href="http://techteapot.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/add-mahalo.JPG" title="Add Mahalo to Firefox integrated search">Add Mahalo to Firefox integrated search</a> &amp; <a href="http://techteapot.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/downloaderror.JPG" title="The Firefox error message">The Firefox error message</a>

The error message is a bit misleading, because you can manually download the file <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/opensearch_desc.xml">opensearch_desc.xml</a>.

The fact that the file is present suggests:
<ol>
	<li>The Mahalo open search file is incorrect;</li>
	<li>Firefox has a poor error message for when an OpenSearch file is incorrect. Instead of saying that the file is incorrect, it says that it is unable to download it.</li>
</ol>
Thought you'd want to know. ;)
