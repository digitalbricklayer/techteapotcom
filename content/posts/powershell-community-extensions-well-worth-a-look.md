I'm a fan of Windows PowerShell <a href="{{< ref "posts/heads-up-windows-powershell.md" >}}">as I've mentioned before</a>. I think it is going to be a boon for Windows admins everywhere.

We've had a stab at support for it too.

If you are currently learning about PowerShell, I'd recommend you check out <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX/">PowerShell Community Extensions</a> project. A large collection of PowerShell tools that will make you more productive.
