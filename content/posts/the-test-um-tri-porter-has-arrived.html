<p>I am happy to announce that the Test-Um Tri-Porter (IVT600) has arrived.</p>
<p>First impressions: absolutely <strong>brilliant</strong>! Three testers (voice, data &#038; video) all in a single solid unit. Oh, and you get a tone tracer too.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t in the on-line shop yet, so please bear with us. It will be available early next week as soon as we have the images and web copy sorted out.</p>
<p>2007 is off to a great start&#8230;and I think it&#8217;s only going to get better ðŸ™‚</p>
