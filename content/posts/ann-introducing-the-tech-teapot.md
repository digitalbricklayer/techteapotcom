Some of you may have noticed a name change. This blog is now called <strong>The Tech Teapot</strong>. Why? Well, we are pretty obsessed with tea :)

We make nice steaming pots of tea at least three times a day. Great for team building!

Our current brew is Waitrose Kenya large leaf tea. Loose leaf tea of course, no nasty tea bags here!
