One of the things that has surprised me about running this blog has been the number of people who subscribe via email.

There is a much easier way to subscribe to this and many other blogs. <del><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Googe Reader</a></del> <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is a web based feed reader making it a snap to keep up with blogs or anything that provides a RSS feed all from a single place. If you've already got a GMail account, you can sign up very easily. If you don't then you can sign up very quickly in a couple of minutes. It will save you lots of time in the long run.

Here is a <a href="http://www.andywibbels.com/flash/google_reader.htm">Google Reader tutorial by Andy Wibbels</a>. There's also <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=65iL0Q97RCg">another one by Capture the Conversation as well</a>. Google have got into the act too with <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VSPZ2Uu_X3Y">Google Reader in Plain English</a>.

<strong>Update March 2015</strong>: Google have unfortunately scrapped Google Reader, I've moved over to <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and find it very useful. You can use your existing Google account to sign-up as well.
