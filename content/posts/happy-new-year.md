<p>I actually refused some chocolate last night...not often that happens! Geese, I need to get down the gym today. :)</p>
<p><img height="192" alt="uglysisters372" src="/image/uploads/2008/01/uglysisters372.jpg" width="372" align="right" />I must confess that I've been looking forward to going back to work for the last few days. The highlight of my holiday was the annual family trip to the <a title="Pantomime review" href="http://yorktheatreroyal.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/review-sinbad-the-sailor-8/">pantomime</a> at the <a title="Theatre Royal York" href="http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/">Theatre Royal in York</a>. The <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2229144,00.html">award winning performance</a> was up to its usual high standard and I recommend a visit if you can make it...the performance runs until the 2nd February.</p>
<p>One nice find over the holidays was a <a title="Practical Common Lisp" href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">free online book for learning Lisp</a>. When combined with <a title="Lisp in a Box" href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/">Lisp in a Box</a> you've got an easy way to learn <a title="Lisp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>I've always hated the look of Lisp, all of those parenthesis and all, and I was determined to find out more. I confess that now I understand where Lisp is coming from, I understand why things are the way they are. You see, everything is a list in Lisp and that includes the language itself. Clever stuff...</p>
<p>Another time sink was <a title="Blitzkrieg game website" href="http://www.blitzkrieg.de/">Blitzkrieg</a>, a real time strategy game set in World War 2, I bought yonks ago but didn't like. I now remember why I didn't like it. A game is not the same as a simulation and should never be confused with one. At times learning Blitzkrieg felt like learning WordPerfect with all of the different key combinations I needed to learn. Sudden Strike is a far better game. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my original game disks so that's why I had to play Blitzkrieg instead.</p>
<p>Normal service will now be resumed.</p>
