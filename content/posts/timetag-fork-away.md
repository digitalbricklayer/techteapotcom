I finally got around to posting the <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/freestuff/timetag">TimeTag</a> source code up on <del><a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a></del> <a title="Continuous delivery every single day" href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> this afternoon. You can find the project <a href="http://github.com/openxtra/TimeTag">here</a>.

Whilst I've no intention of working on TimeTag, I figured that it would be useful for people learning PowerShell development to have a reasonably large sample available, and useful for someone to have a help up if they wanted to implement something similar and don't fancy starting from scratch.

Feel free to fork...

<strong>Update June 2013</strong>: moved the code over to GitHub to make things easier to fork.
