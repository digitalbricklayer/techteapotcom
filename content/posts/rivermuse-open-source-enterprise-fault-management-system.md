John Willis on his excellent CloudDroplets #7 podcast <a href="http://www.johnmwillis.com/droplets/clouddroplets-7-we-had-to-let-jenny-go/">mentioned a very interesting development in the enterprise open source network management space</a>.

<a href="http://www.rivermuse.com/">RiverMuse</a> is an open source enterprise fault management system designed to replicate the functionality of IBM Tivoli &amp; HP OpenView. RiverMuse has been developed by the original founding team of both Micromuse and RiverSoft.

The software isn't available yet, it was due first week of November. I'll let you know when it's released.
