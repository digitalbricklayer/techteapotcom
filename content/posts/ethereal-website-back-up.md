I've noticed that the old <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/">Ethereal website</a> is back up again after being offline for well over a year. The original Ethereal crew, including Gerald Combs the founder, disappeared over to <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, where they created a fork due to problems with trademarks.

Not sure what's going on. The website hasn't been updated since 2007. The last version of Ethereal advertised on the site was 0.99.0 from 24th April 2006.

Is somebody planning on keeping the Ethereal brand going?
