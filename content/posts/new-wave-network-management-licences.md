Michael Tiemann made an interesting post titled <a href="http://www.opensource.org/node/163">Will the Real Open Source CRM Please Stand Up</a>. Alex Fletcher wrote <a href="http://alexfletcher.typepad.com/all_bets_off/2007/06/thoughts-on-osi.html">an interesting follow up</a>.

That got me thinking...how kosher are the licences used by <a href="{{< ref "posts/network-managements-new-wave.md" >}}">the "new wave" open source network management companies</a>? Have <a href="http://www.hyperic.com/">Hyperic</a>, <a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/">Groundwork</a> and <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/">Zenoss</a> really got the open source bug, or do they want the open source kudos without <em>really</em> opening up?

I did a bit of digging around, and I am pleased to say that, at least to my non-legal eye, the licences do look the real deal. All of the tools are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">General Public License</a> (GPL).

You can even download all of the projects without giving any details away too. Nice not to have a salesperson hassling you just because you want to evaluate a project.
