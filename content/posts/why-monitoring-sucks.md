Found an interesting old post by John E. Vincent, <a href="http://lusislog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html">Why Monitoring Sucks</a> tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">MonkChips</a>. What is interesting is what John did next. He created a <a href="https://github.com/monitoringsucks">GitHub account</a> so that he could collaborate with people to rectify the problem.

The most interesting part (to me anyway) is the <a href="https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos">tools-repos</a> repository in which all of the different monitoring tools are listed.

Enjoy! :)

PS: as a counter point, read this post entitled <a href="http://imansson.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/monitoringlove-a-true-story/">#monitoringlove - a true story</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ulfmansson">Ulf MÃ¥nsson</a>.
