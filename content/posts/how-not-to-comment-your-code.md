I was talking to an old time programmer a while ago and he reminisced about a colleague who used to comment his code using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek">Ancient Greek</a>.

So next time you're tempted to criticise one of your colleagues for their poor quality code commenting, just pause and think that it could be a lot worse. Instead of scratching your head trying to figure out what the English means you could be reaching for your Ancient Greek dictionary instead. :)

At least he couldn't use the Greek alphabet because 1950s computers didn't do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicode</a>!
