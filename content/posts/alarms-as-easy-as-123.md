I've been trying to get my head round what the Alarm Numbers mean in  Intellipool INM. Just when I think I've got it everything just slips away. 

The idea seems to be that you can escalate Alerts. If something gets ignored you can change the Action so that a different person gets notified or a new Action gets performed. For example you can take readings from a  <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/products/temperature-monitors/index.html">Temperature Monitor</a> every minute. If a reading is too high the Alarm counter increments, eventually to the point where Alerts are sent out and Actions get performed. What the Actions are depends on what you've set up in the Action list and how you've set the Alarm Numbers. Alarms numbered 1 will be perfomed first, but if they get ignored than a new set, numbered 2 or more will get performed. It's all very clever, but also very hard to explain.


I've started to write a document about it but I'm going to pass it by the guys before I put it up on the website, mostly I want to make sure that I've got it right.
