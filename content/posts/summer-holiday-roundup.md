Summer is nearly over so I thought I'd share our summer holiday destinations with you. Please feel free to leave a comment saying where you went for your summer hols with an appropriate link to Wikipedia or whatever.

Denis managed a couple of weeks in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia">Croatia</a>, including the beautiful town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>.

Annie escaped for a week to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorca">beautiful Mediterranean isle of Mallorca</a>.

Andrea is <a href="http://locationprivacy.org/">currently finishing her PhD</a> so she only managed a few days camping in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District">Lake District</a>.

Dean is a <a href="http://www.formula1.com/">Formula 1</a> fan, so he spent the best part of a week at <a href="http://www.silverstone.co.uk/">Silverstone</a> enjoying the whole F1 circus atmosphere.

For my sins, I haven't had a summer holiday yet, I hope to get away in the autumn. I will be cycling over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmsley">Helmsley</a> youth hostel with my nephew for a night though. I spent a few days there last year and it was gorgeous.
