Is it just me or does everyone find the <a href="http://www.falcom.de/">Falcom</a> Samba 55 GSM Modem a real pain to set up? Loading the driver is OK, but trying to get the Mobile Phone Tools to install is a struggle.</p>
<p>I tried following the instructions on the CD to load the <a href="http://www.bvrp.com/ENG/products/mobilephonetools/default.asp">BVRP Phonetools</a>, it seemed to an obvious place to start! but as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George Bush</a> said after the mid term elections, &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/11/20061108-2.html" class="broken_link">Shows what I know!</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I clicked on software when the CD opened up, then on BVRP mobilePhoneTools setup.exe and it appeared to install OK. When I clicked on Install.exe all I got was an error message, Run-time error &#8217;76&#8217; Path not found.</p>
<p>In fact I had to open the CD and click through software\win32.BVRP_SAMBA\Install.exe. Then plug the Samba 55 into a <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/usb.htm">USB</a> port (it&#8217;s a good idea to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM">SIM</a> in it) and then everything works. At this point I even started to read the installation guide, but the software detected the phone and did all the rest itself.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get the image of a phone on your screen and then you are ready to go.</p>
