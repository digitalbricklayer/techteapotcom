One of the problems with Nagios is that initial set up &amp; configuration can be intimidating to the new user. There are a <a href="{{< ref "posts/top-3-easy-nagios-setup-options.md">}}">number of methods for easing the initial installation problems</a>, but you are still left with an intimidating configuration process.

One option is to use <a href="http://www.centreon.com/">Centreon,</a> a (relatively) new front end for <a href="http://nagios.org/">Nagios</a> with a more accessible web front end for configuration. Centreon is fully open source and is supported by <a href="http://www.merethis.com/">Merethis</a>, a French company, who also sponsor development of the project.

Centreon is similar in concept to <a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/">Groundwork Open Source</a> though far narrower in scope.
