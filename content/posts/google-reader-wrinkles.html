<p>I&#8217;ve just got into using RSS readers (yes, I know I&#8217;m very late on this one!) to keep track of various industry feeds, forums and blogs. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. It is a great example of what web 2 can deliver to enhance our user experience. I bet it&#8217;s a pig to program though, if it&#8217;s easy to use it always is.</p>
<p>I have found a minor wrinkle however. If you add a number of feeds at the same time and then, when trying to categorise the new posts you add a new category, you can&#8217;t add all of the feeds to the new category because the category isn&#8217;t immediately available in the drop down menu. No biggie but a pain nevertheless.</p>
