I strongly recommend you check out <a href="http://servertech.typepad.com/">the ServerTech blog focused on the data centre</a>. The <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/products/remote-power-switches/cC056-p1.html">ServerTech products</a> are available from us, so perhaps we are biased. :)

Support for the <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/products/remote-power-switches/cC056-p1.html">ServerTech manageable CDUs</a> is coming soon to Intellipool Network Monitor. Combine the <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/products/environment-monitors/temperature/cC023-cc081.html">Sensatronics temperature monitor</a> capabilities and you've got a great way to power down/up devices in case your temperatures get out of hand.
