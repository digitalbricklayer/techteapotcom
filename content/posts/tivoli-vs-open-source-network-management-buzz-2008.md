As suggested by Jane Curry in her comment on the <a title="Permanent Link to Open source network management buzz comparison 2008" rel="bookmark" href="{{< ref "posts/open-source-network-management-buzz-comparison-2008.md" >}}">Open source network management buzz comparison 2008</a> post I've compared Tivoli related keywords and selected open source projects. Tivoli covers a lot of ground so comparing it on its own doesn't really tell you very much.

Both <em>Tivoli Monitoring</em> and <em>NetView</em> have been pretty consistent throughout 2008 unlike <em>OpenView</em> which fell substantially. It is odd that <em>Tivoli Monitoring</em> fell off a cliff in December. Presumably, that is just a really heavy seasonal decline rather than anything more fundamental. Maybe Tivoli people get very generous Christmas breaks. ;)
