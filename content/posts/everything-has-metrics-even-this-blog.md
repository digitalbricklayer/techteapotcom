I was struck by something that Tim Nash said in the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/wpleeds/">August Wordpress Leeds meeting</a>. He did an interesting talk about blog metrics. One of those metrics was the number of subscribers.

This blog has around the 600 - 880 subscribers depending upon when you happen to log into Feedburner. Things have become a lot less stable <a href="http://techteapot.com/google-reader-is-dead-long-live-feedly/">since the demise of Google Reader</a>.

One of the things that Tim said is that, if your blog is not enlisting new subscribers, it is probably not hitting the sweet spot with visitors.

That's a grand total of 543 email subscribers.

I've not blogged much in the last couple of years so I can't say I'm surprised nobody has subscribed. This blog has been the online equivalent of an abandoned wild west town.

Probably hasn't helped that the blog boom, such as it was, has long since passed. A lot of the conversations that were happening on blogs have now moved over to Twitter.

Still a place for the blog though. Kinda hard talking about sys admin in 140 characters. :)

P.S. One of the more humbling things about the email subscribers is that a lot of them have subscribed for getting on for 7 years. I bow down to your fortitude. ;)
