Just found an interesting book...if you're a blood 'n guts comms bod then I think this book should find a place in your bookshelf. The book can be found <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=packet_cs">here on the publisher's website</a>.

The author, Chris Sanders, also has <a href="http://www.chrissanders.org/">a good blog too</a>. Well worth adding to your feed reader.
