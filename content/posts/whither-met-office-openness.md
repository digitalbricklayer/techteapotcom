I'm currently in the process of putting together a unit test for an open source project. I wanted to use real <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">met office</a> temperature data, ideally from around York or Leeds.

I emailed the met office to enquire where I could find the data I require. The met office, being a publicly funded body, I naturally assumed the data would be publicly available.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Here's the reply I received:
<blockquote>All free information regarding data can be found at the following webpages <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/index.html">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/index.html</a>

If you wish to purchase data please be aware that it would be a chargable service with data quotations starting from Â£250+VAT</blockquote>
The free information is a set of monthly averages for temperature, sunlight and rainfall going back to 1998. Why is data collected by a publicly funded body not freely available? Think of the innovation that could be unleashed in data visualisation if the raw data were set free.
