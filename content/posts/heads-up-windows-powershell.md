Just a quick <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">heads up about Windows PowerShell</a>. Looks a really neat way to automate a lot of dull, repetitive admin tasks.

Windows PowerShell version 1 has now been released and is available as a free download for Windows XP and beyond.
