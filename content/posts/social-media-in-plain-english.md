Hat tip to the <a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">Elastic Path</a> folks for <a href="http://www.getelastic.com/social-media-plain-english/">finding this one</a>.

If you want a simple introduction to all of the new social media buzz flying around at the moment, I strongly recommend you check out these short tutorial videos by <a href="http://leelefever.tumblr.com/">Lee Lefever</a> at <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Common Craft</a>.

A lot of you may already be familiar with social media. If you're not, then I recommend you check out the videos. Social bookmarking  &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a> are great time savers, especially when you work on more than one computer.

According to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, I monitor 282 feeds. There is no way I could monitor that many sites without RSS.

If you are not already, I urge you to start using RSS. Google Reader is a great RSS reader <strong>and</strong> it's free! You will save yourself a ton of time.
