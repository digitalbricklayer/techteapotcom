...used to be a category leader in ease of installation. It isn't now. You can install very powerful CMS software like <a href="http://www.silverstripe.org/blog/">SilverStripe</a> in under a minute. By comparison, five minutes seems like an eternity.

The SilverStripe installer does away with any database and config file messing around. Just run the install script and bob's your uncle it creates the database <em><strong>and</strong></em> creates the necessary config files for you.

Just shows how you can't rest on your laurels in this industry...what was once industry leading is now behind the curve. A five minute install is wonderful til somebody else comes up with a one minute install.

Oh, BTW...Wordpress 2.7 is out (you are using it) and it is great! ;)
