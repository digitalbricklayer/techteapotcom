One of the tools recommended in <a href="http://www.chrissanders.org/">Chris Sander's</a> <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/packet2.htm">Practical Packet Analysis</a> book is called <a href="http://www.rumint.org/">Rumint</a>.

Rumint is a free, open source packet visualization tool available for Microsoft Windows (written in Visual Basic.)

Roomint's author, <a href="http://www.rumint.org/gregconti/">Greg Conti</a>, has a book to be published by  <a href="http://nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a> called <a href="http://nostarch.com/securityvisualization.htm">Security Data Visualization</a>.

One problem I've run into with Rumint is that it doesn't work on my setup. I run Windows XP and I've got WinPCap  4.0.1. It looks to me like a problem between Rumint and the latest version of WinPCap. The problem is that Rumint won't show any network interfaces to sniff, so obviously things don't work too well. ;)
