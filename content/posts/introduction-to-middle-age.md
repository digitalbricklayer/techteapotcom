At least according to the Collins Dictionary anyway. Of course, according to the Oxford English Dictionary definition, I've got a further five years to go. :smile:

To celebrate I treat my family (all twelve of them) to a play at the Theatre Royal in York to see Twinkle, Little Star.

The protagonist plays a pantomime dame,  for whom life hasn't been altogether kind, playing his last ever season.

The play was expertly played by Kenneth Alan Taylor on top form. As good a 75 minutes straight of acting I've ever seen.
