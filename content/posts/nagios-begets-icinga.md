<a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> is probably the <a href="{{< ref "posts/open-source-network-management-buzz-comparison-2008.md" >}}">best known open source network management</a> tool. <a href="http://archive.fosdem.org/2005/index/interviews/interviews_galstad.html">Ethan Galstad</a> created NetSaint, the tool that eventually became Nagios, many years ago at the very dawn of using open source tools in network management.

Things are not going well. A number of people from the Nagios community, including a couple from the Nagios Community Advisory Board have <a href="http://www.vertical-visions.de/2009/05/06/icinga-is-a-nagios-fork/">decided to create a fork of Nagios</a> under the <a href="http://www.icinga.org/">ICINGA project</a>. The reason? The <a href="https://www.icinga.org/community/team/">founders of the ICINGA project</a> charge <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090510233926/http://www.icinga.org:80/why-a-fork/">Nagios with stifling the development</a> of the project.

It will be interesting to see how much traction ICINGA attains. Forks often fail to gain the necessary momentum to be successful.
