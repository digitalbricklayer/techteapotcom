You wanna do what? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriloquist">Ventriloquism</a> on radio? Oh sure...sounds great. You can start next week!

Currently being re-run on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/">BBC Radio 7</a> is the <a href="http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/radio/archie.htm">Educating Archie</a> show. Which features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brough">Peter Brough</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Andrews_%28puppet%29">Archie Andrews</a> his ventriloquist dummy.

I wonder if Brough used to take Archie to recording sessions? I mean, without it you'd just have a routine with Brough speaking both parts.
