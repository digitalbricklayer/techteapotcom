If you want to know more about voice, data and video cabling we strongly recommend a visit to <a href="http://www.vdvworks.com/UncleTed/">Uncle Ted's Guide to VDV</a>. Highly recommended!

For a great guide to fibre optics, you will find much to enjoy in <a href="http://www.vdvworks.com/LennieLw/">Lennie Lightwave's Guide to Fiber Optics</a>.
