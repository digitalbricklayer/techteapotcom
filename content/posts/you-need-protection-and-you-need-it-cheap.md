We've noticed a small up tick in the numbers of cable testers coming back to us for repair. Nine times out of ten it is a problem with the cable socket caused through wear and tear by inserting and removing the cable during testing. This is great because it means people are really using their cable testers :)

Cable sockets typically have a lifetime of between 500-1000 plug/unplug cycles.

In order to avoid socket wear it is a good idea to use sacrificial cables with your cable tester. That way you protect your cable tester from excessive wear and save yourself the bother of having to have your tester sent away for repair.

Sacrificial cables are cheap too...

Fortunately, both the Test-Um Validator and Validator-NT both come with sacrificial cables as standard.
