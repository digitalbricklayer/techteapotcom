Jane Curry of the UK based <a href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/">Skills 1st network management training and consultancy company</a> has written a rather good <a href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jane/open_source_mgmt_options.pdf">open source network management tool comparison</a>. It is a large PDF file ~150 pages, so you have been warned!

Kudos to Jane for doing the comparison, it must have been a whole heap of work. Enjoy!
