Had a really gross moment last night. I was busy pouring my evening cup of tea (organic rooibos) when what should appear in my cup but a nice big fat juicy slug. How the slug managed to get into my kettle I do not know given that there aren't any obvious ways in (the spout has a filter over it.)

Annie just told me that slug slime is supposed to be used for anti-ageing products so maybe I'll get a nice youthful complexion out of the whole thing. :)
