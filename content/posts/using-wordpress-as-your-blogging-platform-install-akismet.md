We've recently been getting a lot of comment spam on the OPENXTRA Blog. You will never have seen the spam because we have manually deleted it all.

Anyway, we've now enabled the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet Wordpress plugin</a> and things are far far better. Akismet will somehow figure out whether a comment is spam or not and mark it appropriately. Spam it misses that you mark as spam are added to its database for future use. So, it just gets better and better at detecting spam. :smile:

If you are running a blog on Wordpress, please install Akismet it is a real time saver. Wordpress 2.1 and beyond come with it pre-installed so there are no excuses!
