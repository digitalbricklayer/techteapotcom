I ran a survey a couple of weeks ago asking for feedback on The Tech Teapot. A number of you were kind enough to take the time to fill it in.

All of the survey participants are <em>somewhat satisfied</em> &amp; read the blog either <em>frequently or always</em>. The number of readers is currently hovering around the 700 mark with the vast majority of readers accessing the blog via the email subscription option.

Thanks to the readers who took the time to fill out the survey...good food for thought.
