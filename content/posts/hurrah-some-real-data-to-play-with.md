I've written about <a href="http://techteapot.com/whither-met-office-openness/">my woes finding some good test data sets for PowerTime before</a>...some good news. There is a place you can get hold of climate data for free over at <a href="http://eca.knmi.nl/">European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset project</a>. Whilst the temperature data is averaged, the precipitation data is not...so that's what I'm going to use for my tests. The Berlin data set goes all the way back to 1876 with only quite minor disruption during World War 2. Quite an achievement.
