It's kinda like seeing your grand father naked...if you're Linux anyway. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/">Multics sources in all its PL1 glory</a> is now available for your perusal. Surprisingly for a system conceived in 1965, the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">Multics</a> system was shut down only in 2000. Impressive.
