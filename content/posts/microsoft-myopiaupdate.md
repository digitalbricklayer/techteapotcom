I complained in my recent <a href="{{< ref "/posts/microsoft-myopia.md" >}}">Microsoft mypopia</a> post that Microsoft had failed to support the main unit testing framework inside Visual Studio.

Happily, I've found a solution in the form of a Visual Studio add-in called <a href="http://testdriven.net/">TestDriven.NET</a>. Now I can execute and debug my <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> tests all from inside Visual Studio. :)

Just need a bit of wallet surgery first. ;)
