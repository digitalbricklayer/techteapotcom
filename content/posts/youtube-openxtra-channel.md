OPENXTRA now have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/OPENXTRA">channel on YouTube</a>. We've started with three videos so far, more will follow soon. We're monitoring how well things go and would be interested in any feedback you have. Either comment on here or leave your feedback on YouTube if you've got an account.

I know we've got some quality issues with the videos. You may be surprised just how difficult it is to get good shots of devices with LCD screens. If you've got any tips to help make the videos better I'm all ears. Whilst the videos are product specific at the moment, it is our intention to broaden out.
