Tech magazines are becoming a rare breed. Even more rare for them to be in print. I'm sure you read a good number, but I thought it would be good to share my list. Hopefully, you'll share your list. ;)
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.datacentremanagement.com/">Data Centre Management</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.networkcomputing.co.uk/">Network Computing</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.networkcomputing.co.uk/">IT Week</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.comnews.com/">Communications News</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/">Computer Weekly</a></li>
</ul>
For IT VARs and resellers, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.channelweb.co.uk/">CRN</a>.

If you want an exhaustive list of worldwide tech mags then the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141122201525/https://dir.yahoo.com/computers_and_internet/news_and_media/magazines/">Computer & Internet category @ Yahoo</a> is a great resource. Most mags in the UK are run either by VNU or <a href="http://www.cmp.com/">CMP</a>.

If you know of any good ones I've missed, please leave a comment.
