<a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">Elastic Path</a> are enterprise e-commerce software developers. We use Elastic Path software as the e-commerce platform on this website. For the second release in a row they haven't provided a mechanism to import an existing product database into their new release.

I have never come across another software company who hasn't provided at least <em>some</em> form of upgrade assistance with their new software release.

We first started using Elastic Path software version 4.1. We then upgraded to version 5.1, a big improvement. Unfortunately, no mechanism existed in version 5.1 to move our existing product catalogue over to the new version. Nothing. We had to re-enter the information all over again. No small task even for our relatively small product catalogue.

I did let Elastic Path know how annoyed I was at the time. I thought they understood how important an upgrade mechanism is to their customers.

Elastic Path have just released version 6 of their e-commerce software and lo and behold, they have not provided a catalogue upgrade mechanism again. Nothing, not even the basics like category, product and SKU.

The really odd thing is that producing a basic catalogue import mechanism would, compared to the job of developing the rest of Elastic Path 6, be trivial by comparison. We don't know any where near as much about the Elastic Path code base but I doubt it will take us more than a week or two to implement the necessary code. Why risk alienating your existing customers for a week or two of development time?

As a software developer myself, I'd have a hard time thinking of an industry in which companies get away with such shoddy treatment of their customers.
