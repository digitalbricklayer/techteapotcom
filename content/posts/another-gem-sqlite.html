<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open source</a> software never ceases to amaze (and delight) me. I&#8217;ve found another gem, though not a network management package this time!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a> is an excellent embedded database. I&#8217;ve been playing around with it for the last week or so and I am really impressed with it. It&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s simple and it just works.</p>
<p>One of the big problems with a lot of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source software</a> is that the documentation can be a bit sparse. I am happy to say that the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html">Sqlite documentation</a> isn&#8217;t bad. And there are a number of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sqlite+books">books</a> available for it too.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the criteria we have for choosing open source tools is whether they have a reasonable number of books available. When we&#8217;ve had problems before it has always been because of a lack of good documentation. If <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly</a> or another quality publisher has written a book about a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project must have reached a reasonable level of users. Publishers like to sell books!</li>
<li>Reasonable level of reliability must have been reached. Users don&#8217;t like bugs.</li>
<li>Active engagement by a number of developers.</li>
<li>Rich ecosystem of supporting tools and utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to further exploring this gem. It is a great new tool in my software toolkit.</p>
