As I <a href="http://techteapot.com/gadget-ahoy/">mentioned in a previous post</a> we now have a <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/downloads/openxtra-console.php">Google Desktop Gadget</a>. We are pleased to announce that Google have now accepted our Gadget to go on their own Dekstop Gadget directory.

What can I say, we are thrilled. If you have the time please install it and try it out. You will need to install Google Desktop first though.

The plug-in displays the live values from your Sensatronics temperature and environmental sensors right on your desktop.
