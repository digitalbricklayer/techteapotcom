This is a bit of a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/08/is-good-enough-.html">Godinesque post today</a>...not really a tech thing. If you like thought provoking marketing stuff, you can do a lot worse than visit <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/">Seth Godin's blog</a>. Recommended!

I was browsing the TV selection of <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk/">my local electrical retailer</a> in York yesterday. All makes and sizes, from dirt cheap all the way up to 42" Sony monsters. Nice!

What annoys me is that the retailer misses such an obvious trick. Because all of the TVs are hi-def widescreen LCDs you don't get a feel for just how much better these babies are than the heap of junk you've got sitting at home.

If I were the retailer, I'd stick a big ugly, regular TV slap bang in the middle of the whole display, right next to the Sony ultra hi-def kit. Then you'd see why you should shell out over Â£1,000 for one of those babies.

Right now, the display enables me to compare the shop's range of TVs, but it doesn't give me a reason for ditching my ten year old TV. I'd say that persuading me that I need a new TV is a far bigger and more important task for the retailer than helping me understand which TV is the best in their showroom.
