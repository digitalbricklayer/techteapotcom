I&#8217;ve been seeing lots of activity on the Desktop recently. <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> started it all off with their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> built into <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OSX</a>. All very impressive but hardly of much interest to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Microsoft Windows</a> users.</p>
<p>Anyway. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> have brought out a similar system for Windows users called <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a>. It has been through a few versions now and it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>As an experiment I thought it would be fun to create a Gadget as the Google Desktop plugins are called. So, that&#8217;s exactly what I did ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>You can download the result <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/downloads/openxtra-console.php">here</a>. You will need Google Desktop first, you can download that <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Gadget displays the current readings from the Sensatronics range of <a href="http://www.openxtra.co.uk/articles/network-thermometer.php">network thermometers</a>. Please let me know what you think.</p>
