When is the <strong>phone going to come in from the cold</strong>? How much of our lives do we spend continually giving the same information to the same companies time and again down the telephone? Only for those companies to spend even more time typing the same information into their systems.

When are <strong>phones going to be integrated into our PCs</strong> so that you can send your contact details with the press of a button. Then at the other end, with a single button press, they could include the information on a form.

Not only would this <strong>save huge amounts of time</strong>, it would cut out the nightmare of trying to understand what people are saying. Anybody who has <strong>tried to take somebody's email address over the phone will know the problem</strong>. If somebody says "<em>see</em>" do they mean the letter "<em>C</em>", "<em>sea</em>" or "<em>see</em>".

I'm sure we lose thousands of pounds worth of business a year because of miss-communication over the telephone. I doubt we are alone.
