For  a busy technician out in the field the Quicktest  500 is a great tool for the quick and detailed testing of adsl  lines. Without resorting to a laptop with adsl modem attached you can  use it to get the results that really matter - is the adsl service in a  healthy state?

Opening the box was a bit of a revelation. All the  connectors (LAN, ADSL)  and chargers (mains, car and battery) are  there as is a small shoulder bag to hold it all. It is a well built  sturdy tester - slipping on its protecting orange jacket makes it non  slip and stops knocks damaging the unit. I liked the stand that pops out  the back of the unit to allow you to safely prop it up when testing. I  had my first test done 3 minutes after opening the box!

The unit  can be used as a point and shoot device - plug in the adsl connection  and power on. The process then is that the unit runs its diagnostics  against the configurable pass/fail thresholds you set on the unit - and  gives an instant visual display of the stats for several of key  indicators.
<ul>
	<li>In service,</li>
	<li>Is ADSL2+ or adls on the  line</li>
	<li>Line voltage present ? The rates and values for Line speed, Snr margin and line attenuation (bearing in mind you can set the  thresholds to suit the geographical area you work in many of my lines  are rural and at a greater distance from the local exchange)</li>
</ul>
As  in my case when testing, the indicators variously indicated  - pass /  fail - across a range of lines where the key values differed quite  extensively but it is a great time saver before having to dig into  internal  communications and routers to get a definitive answer. The  actual detailed values  found during the tests can be viewed on the LCD  two line panel on the front of the unit using the cursor pad.

The  more expansive tests available after checking the line and service  status, all  relate to DNS / Ping  / FTP and HTTP tests, with a tracert  facility thrown in for good measure.

I didn't get a chance to test  the IPTV and VOIP checking features but know that these will save me  time when diagnosing these more esoteric tests. The transfer of test  data  is facilitated through a usb connector on the unit and through a whizzy web interface when the unit is plugged in to a LAN via the inbuilt ethernet connection.

All in all the unit is pretty much on the  nose as to what an adsl tester should be - compact - sturdy - accurate -  fast and easy to use. The speed of the tests will encourage me to use  the unit to test when I'm on each site I visit  to ensure that the ADSL  service is performing as expected!!!  Definitely one for the toolkit!!  And I may have to disguise it since I think it will be coveted by other  engineers who see the power of it.
