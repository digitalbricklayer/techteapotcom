The resource section has been rather unloved and untouched of late. It hasn't been updated for over a year and I think it is in need of a makeover.

I've budgeted this week to perk things up a bit. One thing I have noticed is that if a section of a website is hard to update it will very quickly fall into disrepair.

So, with that in mind, it is my intention to make the resource section very easy to modify, without any HTML skills. Then there won't be any excuses for not keeping it bang up to date.

I've had <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> on my radar for a while and the resource section is exactly what Rails was designed for. Wish me luck!
