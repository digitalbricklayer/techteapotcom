Over the last week I've been designing a mini-PHP application. No big deal, just a back end admin system with a simple display on the front end with some blog like feedback mechanisms.

I've had a look at the great work the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> people have done with Ruby and wondered whether <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> has anything similar.

Learning Ruby is too big an investment for the simple application I want to write.

PHP does indeed have a number of Rails like frameworks. Unfortunately, none are as mature as Rails. Pitty. PHP 5 is a very capable object oriented language and needs a decent framework to make it competitive.

I've had a look at the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>, <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">Cake PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.pradosoft.com/">Prado</a>. All three are nearly there, but not quite.

The Zend Framework would be my first choice but it falls down on the implementation of the model. I couldn't find much documentation about how to interface to MySQL.

<a href="http://www.phpit.net/">Dennis Pallett</a> has created a <a href="http://www.phpit.net/article/ten-different-php-frameworks/">great comparison of PHP frameworks</a>.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Add <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony</a> to your evaluation list too. Thanks to <a href="http://www.search-this.com/">Sara</a> for pointing it out.
