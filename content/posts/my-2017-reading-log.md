A very bad year for reading over the last year. I suspect that the Playstation 4 got in the way again. No great shame in that. Games can be excellent story telling mechanisms. Just 9 books read in total.

Finished the ***Red Rising*** trilogy this year. I don't think the saga finished as well as it started but still well worth your time.

I do wish that the science fiction and fantasy genre wasn't so driven by trilogies. Personally I find they put me off as much as attract. Reading the first in a trilogy seems like quite a big investment when you know there are a couple of hefty tomes to come. I understand why authors and publishers are so invested in the idea of trilogies, I just wish I didn't have to effectively read the best part of 1000 or more pages to get the full story.
