Things doesn't get much more specialised than packet sniffing. Not many people have the requirement for detailed analysis of the packets flowing through their network.

If you are a student learning how networks work under the hood, you'll find packet sniffing absolutely invaluable. Same goes for a developer creating pretty well anything talking to a network. Making sure your program is sending and receiving the correct network traffic is absolutely invaluable. If you are a network administrator and you are troubleshooting a problem on the network, then it can be helpful to see what is happening at the very lowest level on the network.
