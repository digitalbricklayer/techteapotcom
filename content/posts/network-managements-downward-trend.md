The most puzzling aspect of the <a href="http://techteapot.com/new-wave-network-management-buzz-comparison/">â€œNew waveâ€ network management buzz comparison</a> is the OpenView &amp; NetIQ graph. I find it hard to believe that either OpenView or NetIQ are losing traction in the marketplace. So, how do you explain the fall in their respective number of searches?

<h2>Network management vs network monitor</h2>

First port of call was to see how the industry in general is doing. Whilst far from perfect I think that the <strong>network monitor</strong> &amp; <strong>network management</strong> keywords will provide a reasonable guide to search trends.

Figure 1 looks strangely familiar. The generic terms network management and network monitor both show a very similar downward trend to both NetIQ and OpenView.

You can see in Figure 2, where <strong>network monitor</strong> is graphed along with OpenView and NetIQ, shows the same trend.

<h2>Why the downward trend</h2>

Whilst the graphs are very similar in shape, a steady loss of search volume over the last three years. I am at a loss to explain the reasons behind the numbers.

The usual suspect would be an economic slowdown. Though, I think we can exclude this straight away. Just about everywhere in the world is growing at a fair old lick, including the English speaking nations.

The network management market is mature. Maybe systems are installed and working, so why bother researching a new system when you've bought and paid for a system that works?

Perhaps customers aren't quite as dissatisfied with existing solutions as some believe? If they are dissatisfied, why aren't they researching new, better solutions?
