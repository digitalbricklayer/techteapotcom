Phew...all done. The last site has now been moved to our shiny new server (a Sun based AthlonXp box for the techies out there). Had to do it in a bit of a hurry after a slight misunderstanding with our service provider who switched off the server a couple of weeks early.

Hopefully you were completely oblivious to the changes. If you do web admin properly that's how it should be. The site wasn't down for more than a couple of hours at most.

The consolidation is done now...three do go into one!
