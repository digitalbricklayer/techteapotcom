I am surprised that no network monitor manufacturer has jumped onto <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">Windows PowerShell</a> in a major way. Whilst tools like <a href="http://www.softwarefx.com/powergadgets/">PowerGadgets</a> use the full power of PowerShell, it isn't really aimed at the network manager. It is more of a general IT visualisation tool.

A tool that combined the power and extensibility of PowerShell, with the reporting, graphing and mapping capabilities of a major network monitoring tool would be formidable.

A network monitor with integral support for PowerShell would mean that you could write your own script then leverage the full power of the network monitor in order to periodically run the script, graph the results and alert you when things go wrong.

Over to the manufacturers I think...
