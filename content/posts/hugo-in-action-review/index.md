{{< notice note >}}
The Hugo in Action book is a work in progress at the moment. I have reviewed the chapters that were available in the middle of October. Further chapters are due any time. As soon as the chapters are available, I will update this review.

I have recently ported this [blog over to Hugo]({{< ref "/posts/a-new-dawn.md" >}}). In preparation, I thought it would be a good idea to read a book on the topic. The world is not exactly overburdened with up to date books about Hugo so the shortlist was very short. In Hugo's defence, the documentation provided by the project is pretty good. But, it is always helpful to have an outside perspective.

The main selling point for Hugo in Action is that not only does the book cover the building of static websites, it also covers the very interesting area of merging a static site with the more dynamic side of JAMstack. With JAMstack, you take all of the benefits of a static website like speed and security and add the best bits of Javascript and associated web frameworks.

Unfortunately, Hugo in Action isn't fully off the presses as yet. So I am reviewing a book that is still a work in progress. The only parts of the book that are complete are the chapters around building a static website. The JAMstack chapters are due soon. I will update the review when they are ready.
