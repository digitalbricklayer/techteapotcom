I have recently ported this [blog over to Hugo]({{< ref "/posts/a-new-dawn.md" >}}). In preparation, I thought it would be a good idea to read a book on the topic. The world is not exactly overburdened with books about Hugo so the shortlist of books was very short. In Hugo's defence, the documentation provided by the project is pretty good. But, it is always helpful to have an outside perspective.
