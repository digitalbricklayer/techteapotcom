{{< notice note >}}
The *Hugo in Action* book is a work in progress at the moment. I have reviewed the chapters that were available in the middle of October. The only parts of the book that are complete are the chapters around building a static website. The JAMstack chapters are due soon. I will update the review when they are ready. The book is due to be fully published in December 2020.

I have recently ported this [blog over to Hugo]({{< ref "/posts/a-new-dawn.md" >}}). [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in Google's [Go language](https://golang.org/). In preparation, I thought it would be a good idea to read a book on the topic. The world is not exactly overburdened with up to date books about Hugo so the shortlist was very short. In Hugo's defence, the documentation provided by the project is pretty good. But, it is always helpful to have an outside perspective.

The main selling point for [Hugo in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/hugo-in-action) is that not only does the book cover the building of static websites, it also covers the very interesting area of merging a static site with the more dynamic side of [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). With JAMstack, you take all of the benefits of a static website like speed and security and add the best dynamic bits of Javascript and associated web frameworks.

The book starts with a good overview of the JAMstack and the main benefits to be gained, the main components of a JAMstack site as how it works. There is quite a useful section on why you would need to build a site using the JAMstack. The chapter then moves on to the various options for static site generator. There are a lot of very good options. You may well read the first chapeter and discover that Hugo isn't the best option for you. If that's the case, then money well spent. The book from now on assumes you're going with Hugo and starts outlining the case for Hugo, what you can build with it. If you are going to work with a technology, then you may as well get a compelling reason to adopt it as well as its strengths, weaknesses and alternatives.
