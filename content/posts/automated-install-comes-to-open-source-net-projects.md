One of the nice things about Linux is the ability to install apps (and dependencies) very easily using apt-get or similar. Windows users have been <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2009/11/make-working-with-open-source-breeze.html">missing a similar tool for a long time</a>. Never fear, the <a href="http://twitter.com/scotaltnet">Scottish Alt.Net group</a> have written <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hornget/">Hornget</a>, a tool for installing open source .NET projects.

Quite a few projects are supported, though most are of interest only to programmers. It would be nice to see a lot more user oriented tools like games and the like.

Update June 2011: There is in fact now a far better tool called <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">Nuget</a>, project gallery is <a href="http://nuget.org/">here</a>.

Update January 2013: <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> has been ported over to <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html">Microsoft Windows</a>. Great for installing dependencies in a virtual setup.

Update June 2013: <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> brings apt-get type installer to Microsoft Windows. Seems to be gaining some traction too.
