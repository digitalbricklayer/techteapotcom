I enjoyed creating planet network management so much I thought I'd do it again this time centred around data centers. Friends, I give you planet data center! I've populated the site with feeds from this site's blogroll and my feed reader... if you know of any other data center oriented blogs worth reading, please get in touch.

If you can think of any other planet sites you would like to see, I'm all ears! :)
