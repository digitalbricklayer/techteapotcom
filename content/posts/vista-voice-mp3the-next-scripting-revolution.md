I was quite amused by a story about a potential <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6320865.stm">Vista voice recognition security hole</a>.

It got me thinking that perhaps in the future I'll be able to perform some maintenance tasks on my Mother's PC by sending her a MP3 file of me instructing her computer what to do. Perhaps, I could give her a range of files for performing those little jobs like rebooting her wireless router which I have to do from time to time.

It would be pretty neat...one of the problems with PC automation is organising all of your scripts so that they are usable in a timely manner. No point in saving two minutes by spending five minutes searching for your script.

The voice scripts would also be intelligible to non programmers too. Just listen to it and it will tell you what it is doing. Its meta data is built in.
