This has made my day...we've been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service">cited on a Wikipedia article</a>. Hurrah!

I love Wikipedia and getting a link from them is <em>quite a thrill</em>. It won't change our lives or anything but it is nice anyway.

And for the cynics out there, no we didn't put the citation in ourselves. We've got better things to do. :)
