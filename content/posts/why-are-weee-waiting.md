What is it with people that they always wait until the last minute before doing things? 

Two recent examples have caused me to think about this. One is the deadline for the return of UK Income Tax forms, 31st January. People were driving straight to the door of the tax office on the final day to get things in on time, even though they have known about it since last April!

Second is the requirement for businesses to register for WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment). This has to be completed by 17th March 2007 but loads of companies haven't done a thing about it yet. Even those of us that have registered have found our registration details stuck in the system because of the volume of applications now piling up.

I don't suppose people will ever change.
