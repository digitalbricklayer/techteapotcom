Merry Christmas to all our readers, from everybody at OPENXTRA. Many thanks to Tarus Balog over at <a href="http://www.opennms.org/">OpenNMS</a> for the lovely t-shirt.

OPENXTRA is going to be closed over the Christmas holidays, though we will fulfill online and fax orders. We'll all be back at the Chambers officially on the 2nd January.

The Tech Teapot will be kinda sparse too...unless I get really bored of watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/">The Great Escape</a> for the 40th time.

We had the OPENXTRA Christmas meal on Friday at <a href="http://www.korks.co.uk/">Korks</a>, the finest restaurant in Otley. We were too tight to spring for the full Christmas party menu, so instead we went with the รยก la carte lunch menu. One year we did all go to a greasy spoon for that great English delicacy <a title="Egg and Chips" href="/images/uploads/2007/12/eggchips.jpg">egg and chips</a>. Yummy! Though, if you click through on the link, no self respecting greasy spoon would ever serve salad with egg &amp; chips.
