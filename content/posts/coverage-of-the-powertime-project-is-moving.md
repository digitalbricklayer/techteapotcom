I've decided to move coverage of the <a title="Continuous delivery every single day" href="http://github.com/openxtra/TimeTag">TimeTag time series database project</a> over onto its own blog (or at least my own personal blog).

I doubt too many readers of this blog would be interested in the nitty gritty details of the implementation of PowerTime, so it seems logical to create a more dedicated space for it.

If you wish to keep up with developments on PowerTime, please subscribe to the digitalbricklayer blog.
