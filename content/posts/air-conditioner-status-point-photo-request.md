This may sound like an odd request but I'm going to make it anyway... ;)

Does anybody have any photos of the dry contact status points on their server room air conditioning units that I could use as an illustration on a guide I am currently updating? A picture saves a thousand words as they say and I've got 40 pages already...

If you could contact me I'd appreciate it.
