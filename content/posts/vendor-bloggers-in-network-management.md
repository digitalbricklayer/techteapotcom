... how IÂ  created a planet network management website to aggregate all of the network management related blogs I read. I was just going to do your bog standard list post, but then I thought it would be more fun to have a dedicated website instead.

I'd like to tell you how I've sweated for daysÂ  deep into the night, depriving myself of sleep and sustenance, whilst I slaved over a blinking terminal to get it working... well, I can't because it only took a few hours of not very hard work plus an inexpensive domain name. ;)

The site uses the rather good <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">planet</a> software. The site is a bit stripped down at the moment, I will work on the look as things progress.

If you have any suggestions for blogs to be added, please get in touch. Alternatively, if you are the owner of a blog featured on the site and don't wish to be, please get in touch as well.
