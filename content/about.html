<p>Jack has been doing the rounds in the I.T. industry since 1992 after an illustrious career as a washer upper, gardener &amp; construction labourer.</p>
<p>Most of Jack&#8217;s career in I.T. has been spent at the code face writing a variety of Microsoft Windows software using C/C++, including a stint writing network management software. He even had a spell writing device drivers for a range of long defunct ISDN cards. He did manage to reach one of his life goals by getting a product he worked on into his local PC World store. (He also saw the same product in the remainder bin not long afterwards.)</p>
<p>Jack now does lots of different tasks including stints of programming, inbound marketing, e-commerce and office cleaner. Most of his time is dedicated to helping run <em>OPENXTRA Ltd.</em>, a specialist IT reseller / distributor.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jack Hughes</p>
