The Tech Teapot is the personal blog of Jack Hughes.

Jack has been doing the rounds in the I.T. industry since 1992 after an illustrious career as a washer upper, gardener &amp; construction labourer.

Most of Jack's career in I.T. has been spent at the code face writing a variety of Microsoft Windows software using C/C++, including a stint writing network management software. He even had a spell writing device drivers for a range of long defunct ISDN cards. He did manage to reach one of his life goals by getting a product he worked on into his local PC World store. (He also saw the same product in the remainder bin not long afterwards.)

Jack [recently sold his IT VAR business]({{< ref "content/posts/an-end-to-var-life/index.md" >}}) and is looking for a fresh challenge. If you have an interesting role coming up, please [get in touch]({{< ref "content/contact.md" >}}).

Cheers,

Jack Hughes
