A series taking an in depth look at some of the most prominent open source network management tools from the last 25 years.

The story of a particular location is set out in the various sections of an archaeological dig. In a similar way, the story of an open source project is set out in how the source code has evolved over the project's lifetime. It may also be possible to discern broader technical changes through the evolution of the project.
