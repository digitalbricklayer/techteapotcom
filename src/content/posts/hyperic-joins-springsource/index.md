Congrats to [Hyperic for the purchase by SpringSource](http://www.hyperic.com/blog/springsource/). If you'd bet me which of the [new wave]({{< ref "/posts/network-managements-new-wave/index.md" >}}) were going to be bought first I would have bet on [Hyperic](http://www.hyperic.com/) every time.

What is most gratifying about the purchase is that it is an open source company doing the buying. Whilst I think it unlikely, one of the concerns many people have about the new wave is: what happens if they get swallowed up by some proprietary software company with absolutely no clue about open source.

From a business perspective things look good too, SpringSource have a very similar business model to Hyperic. It makes perfect sense for SpringSource to buy up the eco-system they themselves created by building the Spring framework. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see them expand further into things like enterprise level e-commerce. I'd suggest they look at [Elastic Path](http://www.getelastic.com/) for that... :smile:
