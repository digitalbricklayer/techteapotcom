Brendan from [Sentinal](http://www.secure-eserver.com/) was kind enough to point out a new [open source ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) network mapping tool. It looks really good and so far seems to work! It's called [The Dude](http://www.mikrotik.com/thedude.php), probably sounds better in an American accent, and I tried it on our test network with the following results.

There are more [screenshots](http://www.mikrotik.com/screenshots.php) on the Microtik website.

Did I mention that it's **free**?

I haven't had time to compare it to other tools but it was simple to install and it worked first time.
