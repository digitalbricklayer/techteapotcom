Found an interesting old post by John E. Vincent, [Why Monitoring Sucks](http://lusislog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html) tweeted by [MonkChips](https://twitter.com/monkchips). What is interesting is what John did next. He created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/monitoringsucks) so that he could collaborate with people to rectify the problem.

The most interesting part (to me anyway) is the [tools-repos](https://github.com/monitoringsucks/tool-repos) repository in which all of the different monitoring tools are listed.

Enjoy! :smile:

PS: as a counter point, read this post entitled [#monitoringlove - a true story](http://imansson.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/monitoringlove-a-true-story/) by [Ulf MÃ¥nsson](https://twitter.com/ulfmansson).
