I'm a fan of Windows PowerShell [as I've mentioned before]({{< ref "/posts/heads-up-windows-powershell/index.md" >}}). I think it is going to be a boon for Windows admins everywhere.

We've had a stab at support for it too.

If you are currently learning about PowerShell, I'd recommend you check out [PowerShell Community Extensions](http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX/) project. A large collection of PowerShell tools that will make you more productive.
