Whilst we are on the topic of PowerShell, may as well mention [PowerGUI](http://powergui.org/) as well.

PowerGUI gives you a nice GUI based interface to the command line PowerShell. Dimitry Sotnikov runs [a great blog](http://dmitrysotnikov.wordpress.com/) around PowerShell, PowerGUI and [Quest's other free tools](http://www.quest.com/activeroles-server/arms.aspx). [Quest](http://www.quest.com/) have got into PowerShell big time.
