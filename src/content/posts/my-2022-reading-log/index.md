My favorite book of 2022 was *The Godfather* by Mario Puzo. The film doesn't diverge much from the book but I still found the book a very engrossing read. How true to life the book is is a matter of debate, but true or not, it was a great read. Have to say that *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir was a very close second. Great book that I have no doubt will be a great movie in due course.

I'm a sucker for a *sit at home and do nothing whilst earning a very good living* books so I read quite a bit around Betfair trading this year. I do read the books with much well deserved skepticism. I was not disappointed with *Betfair Trading Made Simple: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Started*. When I compare the trading strategies to the reality of Betfair, I really struggle to see where the opportunity lies. I've played around with the scenarios set out in the book in a spreadsheet and the sums simply don't add up. I am perfectly happy to assume that my understanding is deficient, so my quest goes on...

My favorite non-fiction book is *The Kubernetes Book* by Nigel Poulton. The book is a very good exploration of Kubernetes container orchestration system. I've not managed to use K8 in production as yet, mainly because the main application I deploy simply isn't well suited to Kubernetes. Hopefully, I will be able to get some real experience using K8 during 2023.
