I just read the [my worst nightmare]({{< ref "posts/my-worst-nightmare/index.md" >}}) post again and it occurred to me that I haven't been called upon to fix anything in a very long time.

At least ten years I'd guess.

## What changed?

Twenty years ago, if you wanted access to the internet you needed a PC of some kind. In all probability it would run Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows going back 20 years was incredibly insecure. Most people ran their PC in logged into an admin account giving all programs running access to the entire system. If you visited a website or clicked on an email attachment they had unfettered access to your entire PC.

Not surprisingly, nefarious people took advantage of this digital wild west.

Now, PCs of the same style popular 20 years ago are largely confined to the PC gamer community. The PCs still run Microsoft Windows but these days Windows is much more internet hardened than the versions common 20 years ago. Windows today has very regular security updates and built-in security tools like anti-virus software and a firewall.

Gamers pride themselves on their prowess fixing their PC often after having built their PC from scratch. So thankfully, they have no need of my rather modest PC repairing skills.

What about everybody else?

Everybody else has discovered smart phones and tablets. Today's smart phones are like curated gardens tended with loving care by your manufacturer of choice. If you want to install software, you go to the app store and there you will find a huge range of apps all approved and vetted by your manufacturer of choice.

Installing an app is literally a one touch operation. Want to remove an app? That's a two touch operation. It doesn't get any easier than that. Anybody can do it with absolutely no help from me.
