The folks over at [TweetVOLUME](http://www.tweetvolume.com/) have produced a tool for counting the mentions of words or phrases on the [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) [micro-blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging) platform.

I thought that it would be an interesting, though not especially significant, metric for comparing open source projects.

{{< figure src="twitter-volume-ossnms-comparison.JPG" alt="Comparison of the volume of tweets mentioning Zenoss, Nagios, Hyperic, OpenNMS and MRTG" >}}

The graph above shows the number of twits in which [Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.org/), [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/), [Hyperic](http://www.hyperic.org/), [OpenNMS](https://www.opennms.org/) or [MRTG](http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/) were mentioned according to the TweetVolume algorithm.

The graph [once again shows that Nagios is ahead of everybody]({{< ref "/posts/new-wave-network-management-buzz-comparison/index.md" >}}). The rest are too close to draw any meaningful conclusions.

You can [experiment yourself](http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=zenoss,nagios,hyperic,opennms,mrtg). Enjoy!
