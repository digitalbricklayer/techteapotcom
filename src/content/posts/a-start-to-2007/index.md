Happy New Year to all our readers!

The new year has started off well. We kept the on-line shop working over the holiday period and most days there was activity on it (not Christmas day mind you). Obviously some people take very short holidays and were in work between the Christmas and New Year breaks.

Here's hoping that things continue in the same vein. All the best for 2007!
