Just found an interesting book...if you're a blood 'n guts comms bod then I think this book should find a place in your bookshelf. The book can be found [here on the publisher's website](http://www.nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=packet_cs).

The author, Chris Sanders, also has [a good blog too](http://www.chrissanders.org/). Well worth adding to your feed reader.
