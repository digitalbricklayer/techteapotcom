The Tech Teapot is three years old today. Well, if you want to be pedantic, it was three years old last Thursday but I forgot all about it!

A selection of my favourite posts from the last year:

- [Open source network management buzz comparison 2008]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-buzz-comparison-2008.md" >}})
- [Tivoli vs open source network management buzz 2008]({{< ref "/posts/tivoli-vs-open-source-network-management-buzz-2008.md" >}})
- [Open source network management activity comparison]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-activity-comparison.md" >}})

It has been a thin blogging year, mainly because my time has been squeezed by a combination of my regular work and TimeTag.

Many thanks for reading over the last year.
