... [at least the public release anyway](http://www.rivermuse.com/trial/). I expect if you work somewhere interesting, then it may be worthwhile contacting them in the meantime.

[RiverMuse](http://www.rivermuse.com/) are aiming their offerings solidly at Tivoli, Micromuse and OpenView event correlation users. RiverMuse are going to be using an <em>open cor</em><em>e</em> strategy, so far blazed by Zenoss and Hyperic, in the network management space. The <em>open core</em> product is <em>RiverMuse FreeCool</em> and the feature added, for sale product, will be <em>RiverMuse ProCool</em>.

These guys must lead a charmed life, if anybody else tried to use the names above, they'd have a horde of lawyers snapping at their heals pretty darn quick.
