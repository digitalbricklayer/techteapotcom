Hat tip to the [Elastic Path](http://www.elasticpath.com/) folks for [finding this one](http://www.getelastic.com/social-media-plain-english/).

If you want a simple introduction to all of the new social media buzz flying around at the moment, I strongly recommend you check out these short tutorial videos by [Lee Lefever](http://leelefever.tumblr.com/) at [Common Craft](http://www.commoncraft.com/).

A lot of you may already be familiar with social media. If you're not, then I recommend you check out the videos. Social bookmarking &amp; [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)) are great time savers, especially when you work on more than one computer.

According to [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), I monitor 282 feeds. There is no way I could monitor that many sites without RSS.

If you are not already, I urge you to start using RSS. Google Reader is a great RSS reader **and** it's free! You will save yourself a ton of time.
