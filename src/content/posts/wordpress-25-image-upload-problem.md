If you've made the upgrade to WordPress 2.5 you may have problems with image uploading. The simple answer is to disable the Bad Behavior plug-in and it works just tickety boo. :smile:

<strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/">Michael Hampton</a> has created a patch to solve the above problem. Upgrade to version 2.0.14 and you'll be fine.
