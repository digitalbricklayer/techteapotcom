The server consolidation is continuing apace. Three more sites were moved into our nice shiny new hardened server. The switch-over happened over last weekend and should have fully propagated by now. The old servers are still there...we need to wait for the search engines to pick up the IP address changes. We will switch all of the redundant servers off in a week or so.

You guys shouldn't have noticed anything. Please let us know if anything isn't working as it should. Next weekend will see the end of the server consolidation...just one site to go :smile:
