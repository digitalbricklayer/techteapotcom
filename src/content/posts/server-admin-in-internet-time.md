Over the weekend one of our web servers was hacked... fortunately it wasn't our main e-commerce server. The server is in fact in the middle of being de-commissioned. The hack happened around a day after our software vendor reported a vulnerability and provided a patch.

You sure don't get much time to fix things. You either fix it immediately or **bang** too late.

Thankfully, our system was locked down enough to prevent a root level penetration, only [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) got nailed. Everything is ok now, the software has been patched and fingers crossed :smile:

Just goes to show what a wild west show the Internet really is.
