Richard Aronsson from Intellipool has a post over on his blog concerning using Intellipool to monitor Vista based machines.

Unlike on versions of Windows prior to Vista, the remote registry service is set to manual start-up on Vista. I guess that has been a casualty of the new security sensitivity over at Microsoft. In the past, everything was started by default, and you had to go and switch it off if you didn't need it. Now, and this pretty much falls in with *nix policy, things are switched off by default and you have to switch them on if you do need them. Fair enough!

It will cause some inconvenience to people who expect things to work straight out of the box. As is common in the *nix world, things don't just work out of the box. Time has to be taken to carefully configure things.
