Great news for gadget fans in Europe. [Bug Labs](http://buglabs.net/) have announced the availability of their amazing gadget making kit in Europe with all of the appropriate approvals like RoHS and CE.

In addition Bug Labs have announced the availability of a WiFi <strong>and</strong> Bluetooth base module called [BUGbase WiFi](http://buglabs.net/bugbase).

All you need is a Windows, Linux or Mac PC with the DragonFly SDK installed and buy a Bugbase module, which can now have WiFi and Bluetooth on board, and then choose the add-on modules you need like [BUGbee](http://buglabs.net/modules/bugbee), [BUGsound](http://buglabs.net/modules/bugsound), [BUGvonHippel](http://buglabs.net/modules/bugvonhippel), [BUGview](http://buglabs.net/modules/bugview), [BUGlocate](http://buglabs.net/modules/buglocate) and [BUGmotion](http://buglabs.net/modules/bugmotion).

Then get coding! :wink:
