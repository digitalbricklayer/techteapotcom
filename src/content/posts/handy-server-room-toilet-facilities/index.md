Working in the server room and busting for a pee? You need to install a toilet where it's convenient...yes folks [somebody installed a server room so that you've got to go through the women's toilet in order to enter the server room](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Stalled-Server-Room.aspx).

Just think of all of the time you'd save not having to walk all the way to the men's toilet.
