Tech magazines are becoming a rare breed. Even more rare for them to be in print. I'm sure you read a good number, but I thought it would be good to share my list. Hopefully, you'll share your list. :wink:

- [Data Centre Management](http://www.datacentremanagement.com/)
- [Network Computing](http://www.networkcomputing.co.uk/)
- [IT Week](http://www.networkcomputing.co.uk/)
- [Communications News](http://www.comnews.com/)
- [Computer Weekly](http://www.computerweekly.com/)

For IT VARs and resellers, I'd recommend [CRN](http://www.channelweb.co.uk/).

If you want an exhaustive list of worldwide tech mags then the [Computer &amp; Internet category @ Yahoo](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122201525/https://dir.yahoo.com/computers_and_internet/news_and_media/magazines/) is a great resource. Most mags in the UK are run either by VNU or [CMP](http://www.cmp.com/).

If you know of any good ones I've missed, please leave a comment.
