[Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) is probably the [best known open source network management]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-buzz-comparison-2008.md" >}}) tool. [Ethan Galstad](http://archive.fosdem.org/2005/index/interviews/interviews_galstad.html) created NetSaint, the tool that eventually became Nagios, many years ago at the very dawn of using open source tools in network management.

Things are not going well. A number of people from the Nagios community, including a couple from the Nagios Community Advisory Board have [decided to create a fork of Nagios](http://www.vertical-visions.de/2009/05/06/icinga-is-a-nagios-fork/) under the [ICINGA project](http://www.icinga.org/). The reason? The [founders of the ICINGA project](https://www.icinga.org/community/team/) charge [Nagios with stifling the development](http://web.archive.org/web/20090510233926/http://www.icinga.org:80/why-a-fork/) of the project.

It will be interesting to see how much traction ICINGA attains. Forks often fail to gain the necessary momentum to be successful.
