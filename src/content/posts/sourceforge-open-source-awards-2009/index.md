Looking at the entrants for the [Sourceforge Community Choice Awards 2009](http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/) I am struck by the wide range of applications, but also the quality of the finalists.

In the network management space, [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) is a finalist in the *Best Tool or Utility for SysAdmins* and [OpenNMS](https://www.opennms.org/) is a finalist in the *Best Project for the Enterprise*.

You have until 20th July to [register your vote](http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/).
