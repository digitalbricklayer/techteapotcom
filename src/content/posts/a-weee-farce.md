Over the last couple of years we've donated around Â£2,000 in order to be Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) registered.

In the same period how much toxic electrical waste have we saved from landfill? *None*. Not a single solitary chip or board.

Why don't we all just admit it: WEEE is just another tax and a dumb tax at that.
