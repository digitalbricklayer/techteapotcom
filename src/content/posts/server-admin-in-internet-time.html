<p>Over the weekend one of our web servers was hacked... fortunately it wasn't our main e-commerce server. The server is in fact in the middle of being de-commissioned. The hack happened around a day after our software vendor reported a vulnerability and provided a patch.</p>
<p>You sure don't get much time to fix things. You either fix it immediately or <strong>bang</strong> too late.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our system was locked down enough to prevent a root level penetration, only <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> got nailed. Everything is ok now, the software has been patched and fingers crossed ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Just goes to show what a wild west show the Internet really is.</p>
