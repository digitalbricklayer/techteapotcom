<p>I've just got into using RSS readers (yes, I know I'm very late on this one!) to keep track of various industry feeds, forums and blogs. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. It is a great example of what web 2 can deliver to enhance our user experience. I bet it's a pig to program though, if it's easy to use it always is.</p>
<p>I have found a minor wrinkle however. If you add a number of feeds at the same time and then, when trying to categorise the new posts you add a new category, you can't add all of the feeds to the new category because the category isn't immediately available in the drop down menu. No biggie but a pain nevertheless.</p>
