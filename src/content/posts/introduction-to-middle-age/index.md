![Actor in makeup]("twinkle-little-star.jpg)

I passed the marker buoy on the journey to middle age last week. At least according to the Collins Dictionary anyway. Of course, according to the Oxford English Dictionary definition, I've got a further five years to go. :smile:

To celebrate I treat my family (all twelve of them) to a play at the Theatre Royal in York to see *Twinkle, Little Star*.

The protagonist plays a pantomime dame, for whom life hasn't been altogether kind, playing his last ever season.

The play was expertly played by *Kenneth Alan Taylor* on top form. As good a 75 minutes straight of acting I've ever seen.

A review is available [here](http://yorktheatreroyal.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/review-twinkle-little-star/) and [here](http://yorktheatreroyal.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/review-twinkle-little-star-2/). And there's an interview with the writer [here](http://yorktheatreroyal.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/an-interview-with-philip-meeks-writer/).
