Tough choice for best non-fiction book this year. But, I think I'd plump for **Hannibal** by *Ernle Bradford*. A relatively short book but absolutely superb read. Whilst Hannibal's generalship shines through, I did quietly admire the shear bloody mindedness of the Romans. They just never gave up.

Fiction wise the year was pretty good. Best of all was gorging on the **Witcher** series by *Andrzej Sapkowski*. I've deliberately kept the last two in the series for nice long holiday in the sun somewhere. I'm going to savour them like a vintage wine.

An honourable mention also goes to **Frost at Christmas**. A very good read, probably the best detective novel I've read so far. And there's plenty more where that came from too. :wink:
