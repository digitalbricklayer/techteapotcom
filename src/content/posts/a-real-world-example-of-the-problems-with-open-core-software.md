A [real world example](http://a1emic.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/opennms-so-far/) of what Tarus Balog from [OpenNMS](https://www.opennms.org/) has been banging on about recently with his critique of *open core* or *fauxpen source* as Tarus calls it.

A product manager who has an open product and a closed product plainly has a decision to make over which features go into which product. Give too much away and the value add of the closed enterprise product is insufficient to warrant the licence fees. Put too many features into the enterprise product and the open source offering becomes useless.

Have [Hyperic](http://www.hyperic.com/) and [Zenoss](https://www.zenoss.com/) feature selections leaned too far towards their closed enterprise versions? [Alemic Boiling](http://a1emic.wordpress.com/) would seem to think so...
