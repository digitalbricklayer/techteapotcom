My reading log so far contains ten posts, covering the years 2014-2023. You can see a summary of all of the posts in the table below. The idea for writing a summary of the books I've read over a year I shamelessly stole from *Alex in Leeds* a proper book blogger based in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The blog has gone unfortunately.

| Year  | Books Read  | Non-fiction  | Fiction  | Fantasy  | Sci-fi  | (Auto-)Biography  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2014** | 14 | 6  | 8  | 2  | 5  | 2  |
| **2015** | 12 | 2  | 10 | 2  | 5  | 0  |
| **2016** | 13 | 4  | 9  | 1  | 6  | 2  |
| **2017** | 9  | 3  | 6  | 0  | 4  | 1  |
| **2018** | 8  | 3  | 5  | 1  | 3  | 0  |
| **2019** | 17 | 11 | 6  | 3  | 0  | 5  |
| **2020** | 12 | 6  | 6  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| **2021** | 12 | 8  | 4  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| **2022** | 15 | 11 | 4  | 1  | 1  | 3  |
| **2023** | 13 | 3  | 10 | 5  | 3  | 2  |
| **Total Books Read** | 125 | 57  | 68  | 16  | 28  | 16  |
| **Average Books Per Year** | 12.5 | 5.7  | 6.8  | 1.6  | 2.8  | 1.6  |

The thing that sticks out at first glance is the average books per year over the last ten years standing at 12.5. That means that I have averaged a little over one book per month. I find that *extremely* disappointing.

I really enjoy reading, so why am I managing to find so little time for it?

The second thing that sticks out is the movement from reading primarily fiction over to reading primarily non-fiction. I'm not sure if reading more non-fiction is age related or not. I did pass the dreaded 50 mark half way through the decade I've been logging my reading habits. I did manage to stem the flow last year because I deliberately chose more fiction. I need to monitor my non-fiction reading and steer myself back towards fiction as necessary.
