Over the last week I've been designing a mini-PHP application. No big deal, just a back end admin system with a simple display on the front end with some blog like feedback mechanisms.

I've had a look at the great work the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) people have done with Ruby and wondered whether [PHP](http://www.php.net/) has anything similar.

Learning Ruby is too big an investment for the simple application I want to write.

PHP does indeed have a number of Rails like frameworks. Unfortunately, none are as mature as Rails. Pity. PHP 5 is a very capable object oriented language and needs a decent framework to make it competitive.

I've had a look at the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), [Cake PHP](http://www.cakephp.org/) and [Prado](http://www.pradosoft.com/). All three are nearly there, but not quite.

The Zend Framework would be my first choice but it falls down on the implementation of the model. I couldn't find much documentation about how to interface to MySQL.

[Dennis Pallett](http://www.phpit.net/) has created a [great comparison of PHP frameworks](http://www.phpit.net/article/ten-different-php-frameworks/).

**UPDATE**: Add [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) to your evaluation list too. Thanks to [Sara](http://www.search-this.com/) for pointing it out.

**UPDATE October 2022**: There are quite a few excellent PHP web framework choices around now. Add [laraval](https://laravel.com/) to your list.
