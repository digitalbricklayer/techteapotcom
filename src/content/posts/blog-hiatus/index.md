My posting activity has been a little light of late... and there is a very good reason for that, I've been busy writing some software. Writing software is kinda like the powerful spell in Rincewind's mind in Terry Pratchett's book *The Colour of Magic*, it will prevent everything else from occupying your brain.

Anyway, the software in question is PowerTime. It is now nearing completion and should be available as a first beta real soon. I need to complete some more unit tests, mainly to test use in a multi-threaded environment, and complete and test the installer.
