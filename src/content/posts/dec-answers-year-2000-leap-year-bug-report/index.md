Digital Equipment [answers a user's bug report that the year 2000 is not a leap year](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/joke/decly.htm).

>Various system services, such as SYS$ASCTIM assume that the year 2000
will be a leap year. Although one can never be sure of what will
happen at some future time, there is strong historical precedent for
presuming that the present Gregorian calendar will still be in affect
by the year 2000. Since we also hope that VMS will still be around by
then, we have chosen to adhere to these precedents.

Maybe you've got to work for DEC for that to make any sense. I just love the sarcasm. :wink:
