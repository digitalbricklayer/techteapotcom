<strong>Update 2nd December 2008</strong>: The Popularity Contest Widget has now <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/popularity-contest-widget/">moved to the wordpress.org site</a>. All updates will now appear on the new site.

<a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/">Popularity Contest</a> is a great <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">Wordpress plugin</a> for displaying your most popular blog posts. It powers the <strong>Teapot Highlights</strong> over on the right hand side of this post. :smile:

One thing missing from Popularity Contest is a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/WordPress_Widgets">widget</a>. We created one for this blog, so we thought we may as well share it for everybody else to use too.

<del datetime="2008-12-02T16:05:43+00:00">Place the Popularity Contest Widget in your plugin directory (remember to strip the .txt off the end) then go to Presentation &gt; Widgets. You can then drag 'n drop the widget into your sidebar.</del>

You can edit the title and the number of posts to display. Don't forget to press the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.
