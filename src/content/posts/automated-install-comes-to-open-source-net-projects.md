One of the nice things about Linux is the ability to install apps (and dependencies) very easily using `apt-get` or similar. Windows users have been [missing a similar tool for a long time](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2009/11/make-working-with-open-source-breeze.html). Never fear, the [Scottish Alt.Net group](http://twitter.com/scotaltnet) have written [Hornget](http://code.google.com/p/hornget/), a tool for installing open source .NET projects.

Quite a few projects are supported, though most are of interest only to programmers. It would be nice to see a lot more user oriented tools like games and the like.

*Update June 2011*: There is in fact now a far better tool called [Nuget](http://nuget.codeplex.com/), project gallery is [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages).

*Update January 2013*: [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) has been [ported over to Microsoft Windows](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html). Great for installing dependencies in a virtual setup.

*Update June 2013*: [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) brings apt-get type installer to Microsoft Windows. Seems to be gaining some traction too.
