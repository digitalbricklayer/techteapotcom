Jane Curry of the UK based [Skills 1st network management training and consultancy company](http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/) has written a rather good [open source network management tool comparison](http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jane/open_source_mgmt_options.pdf). It is a large PDF file ~150 pages, so you have been warned!

Kudos to Jane for doing the comparison, it must have been a whole heap of work. Enjoy!
