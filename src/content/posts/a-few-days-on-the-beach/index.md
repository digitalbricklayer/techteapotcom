I'm going on a few days break so I won't be posting for the next few days. Normal service will be resumed next week. Whilst I will be at the seaside it most certainly won't look anything like the picture. The good thing about the hotel is that it is slap in the middle of Whitby &amp; [Scarborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire) on the cycle route using the old railway line. A perfect spot for a bit of cycling, weather permitting. From the looks of the forecast yesterday I may have timed things perfectly. :smile: Where would cycling be without [Dr Beeching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_Axe)...
