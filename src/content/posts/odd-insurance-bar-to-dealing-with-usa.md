Just rung up [direct line for business](http://www.directlineforbusiness.co.uk/) to get a quote for our compulsory [Employers' Liability Insurance](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/hse39.pdf) and was refused because we have dealings with companies in the USA! Weird... I'm really surprised because Direct Line is a pretty big insurer. I'd love to know what the problem is with having dealings with the USA?

Suffice it to say all of the quotes have gone up this year. :wink:
