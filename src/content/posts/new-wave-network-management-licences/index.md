Michael Tiemann made an interesting post titled [Will the Real Open Source CRM Please Stand Up](http://www.opensource.org/node/163). Alex Fletcher wrote [an interesting follow up](http://alexfletcher.typepad.com/all_bets_off/2007/06/thoughts-on-osi.html).

That got me thinking...how kosher are the licences used by [the "new wave" open source network management companies]({{< ref "/posts/network-managements-new-wave.md" >}})? Have [Hyperic](http://www.hyperic.com/), [Groundwork](http://www.groundworkopensource.com/) and [Zenoss](https://www.zenoss.com/) really got the open source bug, or do they want the open source kudos without *really* opening up?

I did a bit of digging around, and I am pleased to say that, at least to my non-legal eye, the licences do look the real deal. All of the tools are licensed under the [General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL) (GPL).

You can even download all of the projects without giving any details away too. Nice not to have a salesperson hassling you just because you want to evaluate a project.
