If you want to know more about voice, data and video cabling we strongly recommend a visit to [Uncle Ted's Guide to VDV](http://www.vdvworks.com/UncleTed/). Highly recommended!

For a great guide to fibre optics, you will find much to enjoy in [Lennie Lightwave's Guide to Fiber Optics](http://www.vdvworks.com/LennieLw/).

Both of the above have been created by [VDV Works](http://www.vdvworks.com/) a [voice, data and video cable training company](http://www.vdvworks.com/vdvacademy/) in the USA.
