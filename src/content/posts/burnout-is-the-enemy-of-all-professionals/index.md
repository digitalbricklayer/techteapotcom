The chances are that the vast majority of the people reading this post are professional IT people in some capacity or another.

As professionals we are prone to burn out unless we take specific precautions to prevent it. Bashing your head against the IT firewall everyday can leave you feeling a bit empty and burnt out.

From my own perspective I have certainly been burnt out on this blog for at least a couple of months. I've had big problems coming up with topics to talk about, a sure sign of blogger burnout.

Fortunately, yesterday I felt much more refreshed and I was able to list three new topics I wish to talk about. So what caused this turn around?

On Friday I met [a group of northern bloggers at a meeting in Leeds](http://www.zath.co.uk/northern-uk-bloggers-meet-up/). I must confess that my blogger muscles feel much refreshed and I can't wait to get stuck in again.

If you are feeling a little bit jaded with the IT industry and need to get some of the enthusiasm back that brought you into the industry in the first place, you could do a lot worse than join a group with a few industry colleagues and just chew the fat in an informal setting. It is something that I believe our American colleagues do far more than we do and perhaps is responsible, at least in part, for their more vibrant IT industry.

Many thanks to: [Chris Garrett](http://www.chrisg.com/) &amp; Jamie Harrop for organising the event and the rest of the participants: Richard, Andrew, Tim, Andrew, [Dominic](http://www.thehodge.co.uk/) (I owe Dominic a pint of Hoegarden so I've got to keep him sweet :smile: ), [Zath](http://www.zath.co.uk/) for being there. Thanks and I hope to see you at the next meeting. :wink:
