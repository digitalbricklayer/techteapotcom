Summer is nearly over so I thought I'd share our summer holiday destinations with you. Please feel free to leave a comment saying where you went for your summer hols with an appropriate link to Wikipedia or whatever.

Denis managed a couple of weeks in [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia), including the beautiful town of [Dubrovnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik).

Annie escaped for a week to the [beautiful Mediterranean isle of Mallorca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorca).

Andrea is [currently finishing her PhD](http://locationprivacy.org/) so she only managed a few days camping in the [Lake District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District).

Dean is a [Formula 1](http://www.formula1.com/) fan, so he spent the best part of a week at [Silverstone](http://www.silverstone.co.uk/) enjoying the whole F1 circus atmosphere.

For my sins, I haven't had a summer holiday yet, I hope to get away in the autumn. I will be cycling over to [Helmsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmsley) youth hostel with my nephew for a night though. I spent a few days there last year and it was gorgeous.
