Over the weekend my wireless adaptor at home gave up the ghost. Not being the greatest fan of my wireless network at home (I find it too unreliable and slow) I took the opportunity to look at [power line networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerline_networking).

I took myself off to my local PC World and grabbed one of the Devolo Homeplug High Speed Starter Kits.  Got home, plugged in; configured my PC with a static IP address; and *hay presto *I was up and running.

I was surprised just how smoothly the installation went, everything worked without a hitch ....so far!

If you are using DHCP, the power line networking would have been completely configuration free. Just plug-in and go!

The only downside I can see is the price.  Two adapters for around Â£85-90 is marginally above the cost of an equivalent wireless network. Though, you don't have to worry about security or wireless reception. Both good reasons to pay a little more money for peace of mind.

If you are wary of wireless, give power line networking a try. Recommended!
