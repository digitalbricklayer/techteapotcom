... between [various flavours of Windows](http://www.paessler.com/blog/2009/06/03/network-monitoring-basics/dont-use-windows-vista-and-windows-2008-for-network-monitoring-via-wmi/). Not sure what Microsoft have done on Vista and Server 2008 but it hasn't half slowed down WMI performance. Thankfully the latest release candidate of Windows 7 has much improved performance.
