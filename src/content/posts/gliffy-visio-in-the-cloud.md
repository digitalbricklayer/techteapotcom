If you think of <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a> as Visio delivered as a web based app you'd be about right, just like <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>. Google, if you've got a spare few million bucks (and we all know you do), will you just buy Gliffy? And then integrate it into Google Docs. This stuff is way too good to waste behind a paid-for monetisation strategy.
