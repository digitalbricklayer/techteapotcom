I am happy to announce that the Test-Um Tri-Porter (IVT600) has arrived.</p>

First impressions: absolutely **brilliant**! Three testers (voice, data &#038; video) all in a single solid unit. Oh, and you get a tone tracer too.

It isn't in the on-line shop yet, so please bear with us. It will be available early next week as soon as we have the images and web copy sorted out.

2007 is off to a great start... and I think it's only going to get better :wink:
