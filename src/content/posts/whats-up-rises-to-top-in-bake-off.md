CRN Tech put network management solutions up against one another and gave Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold Premium v11 first-place for its robust features, strong troubleshooting capabilities and comprehensive reports. Engineers were particularly impressed with its feature set, price/performance and integration capabilities, giving it top marks across those three categories. <a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/products/LANsurveyor/index.aspx">SolarWinds LANSurveyor 10 </a>came second, with <a href="http://www.adremsoft.com/netcrunch/index.php">AdRem Netcrunch</a> (personally I've not heard of this) third. The full article puts these solutions through their paces and is worth a read.
