Al over at [The Open Sourcerer](http://www.theopensourcerer.com/) mentioned in the comments of the ultimate low power server post another [low power server running Ubuntu](http://www.viglen.co.uk/viglen/Products_Services/Product_Range/Product_file.aspx?eCode=XUBUMPCL&amp;Type_Info=Description&amp;Type=Desktops&amp;GUID=) but for the bargain price of Â£99! There's no Microsoft Windows option or WiFi but who cares for that price.
