We're busy upgrading our internal network here at the Chambers. We need to host a number of devices on our internal network so that prospects can evaluate them before they part with their hard earned cash.

One of the problems we're having is identifying a decent broadband router that's got all of the features we want but is also easy to install. We've tried the 800 pound gorilla of the networking world Cisco and found them wanting.

One of the big problems in computer equipment procurement is finding equipment in the middle of the price/functionality bracket.

Finding equipment at the low end is easy. Go along to your local electrical retailer and you'll find a wide range of products for very modest prices from manufacturers like Netgear &amp; Zoom.

At the top end of the market your choices are more limited. The equipment at the top end isn't designed to be user installed or operated. You've got to get one of the high priesthood of certified professionals to install and run your equipment for you.

In the middle market though things are a problem. The likes of Cisco bring an enterprise priesthood only vibe to their mid-range products.

Do you know of any good, feature rich routers out there that your regular joe can install?
