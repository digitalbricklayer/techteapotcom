I couldn't help but laugh at the kitchen in Microsoft's Home of the Future. Everybody knows that nothing dates like visions of the future, but this takes the biscuit (or the [focaccia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focaccia), see below). I'm still waiting for my jetpack and my nuclear powered million-miles-to-the-gallon car that I was promised when I was a child, but it looks like I'll have to wait a while yet.

Anyway Microsoft are going to computerise everything in the kitchen (they would wouldn't they) and it's the most bizarre mix of things you've ever heard of. In this [article](http://www.microsoft.com/canada/home/styleandhome/2.3.27_thedigitalhomecookinginthehightechkitchen.aspx) some poor woman is gagging for a tub of mass produced, bar and RFID coded, microwaved instant soup one minute (I wonder if Microsoft will branch out into the soup kitchen market?) and the next she's making focaccia from scratch! She can't even spell the word!, really take a look. Just to make sure she's wound up the computer's talking to her all the while and projecting the recipe on top of whole lot (more likely the back of her head). And the voice appears to sound like [Steven Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) does Masterchef.

I'm guessing that if she can't make a bowl of soup the bread's going to be something to behold. Anybody fancy a Microsoft cookbook?

Touch screens in the kitchen are a tremendous idea. I bet poking the screen with flour covered fingers will really help readability!

Every detail of your family's life is in the calendar waiting for Windows 2036pro service pack 17 to crash and lose the lot. (See how I'm doing a little bit of future gazing myself here!)

I'm too scared to look at the rest of the house.

Can I make a plea to everyone? Can we please keep Microsoft out of the kitchen? I wonder if they are taking orders for jetpacks...
