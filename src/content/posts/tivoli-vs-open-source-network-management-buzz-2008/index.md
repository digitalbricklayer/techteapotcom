As suggested by Jane Curry in her comment on the <[Open source network management buzz comparison 2008]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-buzz-comparison-2008.md" >}}) post I've compared Tivoli related keywords and selected open source projects. Tivoli covers a lot of ground so comparing it on its own doesn't really tell you very much.

Both *Tivoli Monitoring* and *NetView* have been pretty consistent throughout 2008 unlike *OpenView* which fell substantially. It is odd that *Tivoli Monitoring* fell off a cliff in December. Presumably, that is just a really heavy seasonal decline rather than anything more fundamental. Maybe Tivoli people get very generous Christmas breaks. :wink:
