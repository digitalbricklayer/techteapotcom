I've been seeing lots of activity on the Desktop recently. [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) started it all off with their [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/dashboard.html) built into [OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/). All very impressive but hardly of much interest to [Microsoft Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) users.

Anyway. [Google](http://www.google.com/) have brought out a similar system for Windows users called [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/). It has been through a few versions now and it looks pretty good.

As an experiment I thought it would be fun to create a Gadget as the Google Desktop plugins are called. So, that's exactly what I did 🙂

You can download the result here. You will need Google Desktop first, you can download that [here](http://desktop.google.com/).

The Gadget displays the current readings from the Sensatronics range of [network thermometers](https://www.openxtra.co.uk/kb/network-thermometer-introduction.html). Please let me know what you think.
