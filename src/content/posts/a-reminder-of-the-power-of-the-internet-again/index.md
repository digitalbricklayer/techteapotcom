[Some time ago]({{< ref "/posts/a-reminder-of-the-power-of-the-internet/index.md" >}}) I had a reminder of just how powerful the internet can be. I can log into a website, schedule one of a number of expensive astronomical telescopes to take a photo of whatever takes my fancy.

The telescope that took the image below is based on the top of a mountain in Tenerife. The [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) own and run the telescopes. The Open University started in the UK in the late 1960s with a vision for opening up access to higher education for all regardless of their academic background. I have access to the telescopes because I used to pay for access prior to the university taking over the website and telescopes. Now I get access and I don't have to pay :blush:. The telescopes are most commonly used as part of the Open University's astronomy classes. Instead of just getting a lot of theory of astronomy, you get quite a lot of practical experience too. Best of all, some of the classes are free.

[telescope.org](http://telescope.org) is not the only internet enabled telescope. There are quite a few options especially if you are happy to pay. For instance, [iTelescope](https://www.itelescope.net/) has 18 telescopes in 5 observatories including Australia, Spain, Peru and USA. Plans start at a mere &pound;14.95 per month.
