I read a total of 13 books in 2016. Maybe slightly higher than average but not by much.

Only four non-fiction books this year. The highlight, if that's the right word, of the non-fiction books was the biography of *Jimmy Savile* written by ***Dan Davies***. A very close second was ***SPQR*** written by Mary Beard. If you've any interest in ancient Rome, then you'll really enjoy ***SPQR***.

Fiction wise I'd say it was a pretty good year. ***Red Rising*** by ***Pierce Brown*** was excellent and probably the best book of the year. I read the second book of the *Red Rising Saga* pretty well straight away which does indicate how good the first book in the saga is.

I really enjoyed the first *Harry Potter* book too. I'm not sure why I was surprised by that. Probably just a bit of snobbishness on my part. I haven't read any further in the series as yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it at some point. The main thing that puts me off is the books do start to rapidly grow ever longer the further into the series you go. From a practical point to view I really need to read a long book on holiday. And I rarely like to dedicate a whole holiday to reading a solitary book. Seems like quite a risk.
