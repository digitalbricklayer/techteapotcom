[Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software never ceases to amaze (and delight) me. I've found another gem, though not a network management package this time!

[Sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is an excellent embedded database. I've been playing around with it for the last week or so and I am really impressed with it. It's quick, it's simple and it just works.

One of the big problems with a lot of [open source software](http://www.opensource.org/) is that the documentation can be a bit sparse. I am happy to say that the [Sqlite documentation](http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) isn't bad. And there are a number of [books](http://www.google.com/search?q=sqlite+books) available for it too.

In fact, one of the criteria we have for choosing open source tools is whether they have a reasonable number of books available. When we've had problems before it has always been because of a lack of good documentation. If [Apress](http://www.apress.com/), [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/) or another quality publisher has written a book about a project:

- The project must have reached a reasonable level of users. Publishers like to sell books!
- Reasonable level of reliability must have been reached. Users don't like bugs.
- Active engagement by a number of developers.
- Rich ecosystem of supporting tools and utilities.

I look forward to further exploring this gem. It is a great new tool in my software toolkit.
