Any super observant readers may have noticed some problems with the blog comment system. Long comments wouldn't display properly. The comment author name would appear correctly but the comment itself wouldn't be displayed.

We've tracked it down to being a plug-in problem. I decided to selectively deactivate plug-ins until the comments worked properly again. The [SEM Do follow plug-in](http://www.semiologic.com/software/dofollow/) looks to be the candidate...when I deactivated it long comments went back to being displayed properly.

Thanks to Tarus &amp; [Mark](http://www.socializedsoftware.com/) for being so patient whilst we worked on the problem.
