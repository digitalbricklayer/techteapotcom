Looking at the entrants for the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/">Sourceforge Community Choice Awards 2009</a> I am struck by the wide range of applications, but also the quality of the finalists.

In the network management space, <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> is a finalist in the <em>Best Tool or Utility for SysAdmins</em> and <a href="https://www.opennms.org/">OpenNMS</a> is a finalist in the <em>Best Project for the Enterprise</em>.

You have until 20th July to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/">register your vote</a>.
