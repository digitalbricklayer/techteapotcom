Tools like the Test-Um Wi-Net are great for trouble shooting wireless networks. But, Wi-Net falls a long way short of giving you real low level technical insight into your wireless network. What do you do if you need more? Say, you need to capture packets and the like.

{{< figure src="wireshark_ampdu_big.png#center" alt="Airpcap capture" title="Wireshark Capturing Wi-Fi traffic using AirPcap" >}}

One solution is to use the [WireShark](http://www.wireshark.org/) + [AirPcap](http://www.riverbed.com/products/performance-management-control/network-performance-management/wireless-packet-capture.html) combination.

WireShark I'm sure most of you have heard of. Formerly known as Ethereal, it is a very capable open source packet capture tool for a variety of platforms including Microsoft Windows. And the best bit? It's free!

AirPcap is a family of wireless interface cards and associated drivers, ideal for use with WireShark, to capture packets on wireless networks all the way up to 802.11n. The cards cost from $198 each.
