I've been tinkering with the current generation of AI for a while now. I am amazed by the image generation capabilities of Copilot. I've already used generative AI to suggest blog names for my personal hobby blog and to generate a logo for it is as well.

This got me thinking. How good is generative AI at more IT related tasks and what would be a good test ground?

There is no point in choosing something obscure to test with, so I need something old and well known to give the AI a chance. You can't get better known than Nagios in the system monitoring space and it is certainly old enough to have garnered plenty of food for the AI to learn from.

My test is going to be installing Nagios on an Ubuntu 22.04 host using three different methods: *Ansible*, *Docker* and a plain old *shell script*.

## Ansible

### Ansible with Microsoft Copilot 

### Ansible with Google Gemini Pro

## Docker

### Docker with Microsoft Copilot

### Docker with Google Gemini Pro

## Shell Script

### Shell script with Microosft Copilot

### Shell script with Google Gemini Pro

## Conclusion
