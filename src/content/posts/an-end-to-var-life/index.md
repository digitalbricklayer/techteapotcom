My reflections on nearly 20 years with OPENXTRA Limited a Value Added Reseller I co-founded all the way back in early 2003.

<!--more-->

## An End

OPENXTRA Limited closed their doors for the last time on X. OPENXTRA was a Value Added Reseller in the server room environment monitoring market principally with a sideline as a supplier of ethernet enable power switches.

## The Beginning

I co-founded OPENXTRA Limited all the way back in February 2003. The original idea was to curate a set of open source tools running on Microsoft Windows and provide paid support. The first product was called [OPENXTRA BASICS](https://openxtra.org/project/basics). It consisted of a single installer for Ethereal (now called [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)), [MRTG](https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/), [NTop](https://www.ntop.org/) and quite a few other smaller tools like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and [net-snmp](http://www.net-snmp.org/) all with a nice easy to use Window based installer. The goal was that when you'd finished installing the tool or tools you wanted you were ready to go. No messy configuration. We largely achieved that goal too.

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, open source tools were very painful to install and configure. Microsoft Windows was also not a huge priority for many open source projects. That is the world that the original idea for OPENXTRA Limited was born in late 2002.

The tools were wildly popular far exceeding my expectations. The paid support was really *not* popular. In fact, over a period of at least six months we managed to sell a single support contract for the princely sum of around $49.00. Not the kind of money that is going to keep four people in rent.

The upside of this failure is that at least we knew pretty quickly that it wasn't working and that we needed to find something else. The venture capitalists tell you to fail fast and we *definitely* did that.

Our one lucky break, in spite of all the effort we put into trying to get it, was that we didn't have any external investors like angel investors or venture capital. That would not have been fun. We had a small *friends and family* round and they lost all of their investment. Those conversations were not the easiest to have and I have no plans to *ever* have them again.

This period in the company I look back with a huge amount of fondness. There was a real mission all four of us felt and we were all determined to get there.

I didn't get paid for more than a year so I remember a strange combination of being completely enthused with our mission and being completely *skint*. In fact, I sold pretty well everything I owned at the time. If I still own anything from back then, it is because I couldn't find anybody to sell it to. :smile:

## VAR Life Begins

Something had to give. You can't run on zero money for ever.

If we couldn't sell support for the tool, maybe we could sell products of interest to people who were interested in the tool.

We started an e-commerce side of the website. Nothing very complicated by modern standards just a [shopping cart tacked onto our regular website](https://www.mals-e.com/). We'd recently transitioned from a purely static website edited in Dreamweaver to a PHP based site. The site was incredibly primitive and yet people were quite happy to buy things. Selling online is absolutely magical and the magic has never really left.

First product on the website was a wireless intrusion detection system produced by a startup in Silicon Valley. It initially sold okay but soon stopped selling. I think the drop off was due to me changing the keywords we were advertising on. We weren't tracking the ad spending very well at this point, so it is hard to pinpoint the exact cause. If you are paying for online advertising, you have to track the spend from day one.

The startup didn't last long. This is something of a *recurring* pattern.

The second product we put up on the website was very different. It was an ethernet environment monitor manufactured by Sensatronics. Within the first few hours these just flew off the shelves. The manufacturer sent us a demo unit and before we'd managed to unbox it to give it a go, we'd sold it.

This was the first time I thought OPENXTRA might have a long term future. That I might *finally* get paid! :smile:

Around 2006 or 2007 we did do some things I think were genuinely innovative. We paid a large four figure sum for a Java based e-commerce platform. We built what I think for a time in the late 2000s was a leading e-commerce website in our tiny niche.

## The Great Recession Hits

For a long time things went on as before.

The thing that hit us hardest were supplier issues. Suppliers get bought out by larger companies. It is a fact of VAR life. What surprised me was the number of suppliers being bought out and the fact that a number simply dumped the existing suppliers.

We put a lot of effort into building a customer base for some of these companies and it is heart breaking to see all of that effort wasted. Worse, the customers we had to let go, often held us responsible when we had no control over the situation at all.

## Google Gave and Google Hath Taken Away

In 2012 we were hit pretty bad by one of Google's periodic updates. Google makes changes to their ranking algorithm and some websites go up and some go down. It was our turn to go down. We were not dropped down by much but the difference between ranking in first place for a search and ranking in third place is the difference between night and day.

Things are a bit different these days, the difference isn't so marked because all organic listings are so far down the page. The result in \#1 position in 2022 is in the same place as \#3 or lower from the 2008 search results. (As an aside, see for a comparison of one [Google search result between 2001, 2008 and 2022]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-in-google-2001-vs-google-2008/index.md" >}}).)

## COVID-19

## The End

OPENXTRA has always been run quite conservatively. We don't have flash cars our office could politely be described as utilitarian etc. We've always kept things as lean as possible. We have always kept a sizeable five figure sum in the bank for rainy days. This got us through the tough times of the Great Recession, the Google ranking drop and COVID-19. But we were lucky that each of the previous crises were well spaced out. We were able to slowly top up the rainy day fund between crises. Unfortunately, the most recent Ukraine crisis has come hot on the heals of COVID-19. We didn't have the opportunity to build our rainy day fund back up after COVID.

There comes a time when you run out of road. The good trading conditions likely to happen after the Ukraine crisis is over are just too far away for us.

It has certainly been a roller coaster. I have certainly made my fair share of mistakes over the last twenty years. But, I don't regret any of it.

## A New Beginning

As for me personally, I am busy up-training in DevOps. Cisco in cooperation with the Open University offer digital skills training. I am currently studying the Cisco DevNet Associate course. I already have quite a few years Linux experience and Ansible. Or I might go back to programming.

I do seem to specialise in job hunting during a recession. When I first exited university it was during the early 1990s recession and here I am trying to do the same during the 2022 version.
