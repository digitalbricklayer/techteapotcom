My reflections on nearly 20 years with OPENXTRA Limited a Value Added Reseller I co-founded all the way back in early 2003.

<!--more-->

## An End

OPENXTRA Limited closed their doors for the last time on X. OPENXTRA was a Value Added Reseller in the server room environment monitoring market principally with a sideline as a supplier of ethernet enabled power switches.

## The Beginning

I co-founded OPENXTRA Limited all the way back in February 2003. The original idea was to curate a set of open source tools running on Microsoft Windows and provide paid support. The first product was called [OPENXTRA BASICS](https://openxtra.org/project/basics). It consisted of a single installer for Ethereal (now called [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)), [MRTG](https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/), [NTop](https://www.ntop.org/) and quite a few other smaller tools like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and [net-snmp](http://www.net-snmp.org/) all with a nice easy to use Window based installer. The goal was to make installing the network management tools as easy as installing a regular Windows application. No messy configuration. We largely achieved that goal too.

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, open source tools were very painful to install and configure. Microsoft Windows was also not a huge priority for many open source projects. That was the world into which the original idea for OPENXTRA Limited was born in late 2002.

The tools were wildly popular far exceeding my expectations. The paid support was really *not* popular. In fact, over a period of at least six months we managed to sell just a single support contract for the princely sum of around $49.00. Not the kind of money that is going to keep four people in rent.

The upside is that at least we knew pretty quickly that it wasn't working and that we needed to find something else. The venture capitalists tell you to fail fast and we *definitely* did that.

Our one lucky break, in spite of all the effort we put into trying to get it, was that we didn't have any external investors like angel investors or venture capital. That would not have been fun. We had a small *friends and family* round and they lost all of their investment. Those conversations were not the easiest to have and I have no plans to *ever* have them again.

This period in the company I look back with a huge amount of fondness. There was a real mission all four of us felt and we were all determined to get there.

I didn't get paid for more than a year so I remember a strange combination of being completely enthused with our mission and being completely *skint*. In fact, I sold pretty well everything I owned at the time. If I still own anything from back then, it is because I couldn't find anybody to sell it to. :smile:

## VAR Life Begins

Something had to give. You can't run on zero money forever.

If we couldn't sell support for the tools, maybe we could sell products of interest to people who were interested in the tools.

We started an e-commerce side of the website. Nothing very complicated by modern standards just a [shopping cart tacked onto our regular website](https://www.mals-e.com/). We'd recently transitioned from a purely static website edited in Dreamweaver to a PHP based site. The site was incredibly primitive and yet people were quite happy to buy things. Selling online is absolutely magical and I never really lost the magic even after twenty years.

First product on the website was a wireless intrusion detection system produced by a startup in Silicon Valley. It initially sold okay for a while but soon stopped selling. I think the drop off was due to me changing the keywords we were advertising on. We weren't tracking the ad spending very well at this point, so it is hard to pinpoint the exact cause. If you are paying for online advertising, you *have* to track the spend from day one.

The startup didn't last long. This is something of a *recurring* pattern.

The second product we put up on the website was very different. It was an ethernet environment monitor manufactured by Sensatronics. Within the first few hours these just flew off the shelves. The manufacturer sent us a demo unit and before we'd managed to unbox it to give it a go, we'd sold it.

This was the first time I thought OPENXTRA might have a long term future and that I might *finally* get paid! :smile:

Around 2006 or 2007 we did do some things I think were genuinely innovative. We paid a high four figure sum for a Java based e-commerce platform. We built what I think for a time in the late 2000s early 2010s was the leading e-commerce website in our tiny niche.

Many thanks to *Dean* for his sterling work on the various websites.

## The Great Recession Hits

For a long time things went on as before. Much to my surprise. Slowly, due to a long period of government austerity, whole sectors of the economy just disappeared. We'd done pretty well with local government and higher education and it was as if somebody just switched off the tap one day.

The thing that hit us hardest were supplier issues. Suppliers get bought out by larger companies. It is a fact of VAR life. What surprised me was the number of suppliers being bought out and the fact that a number simply dumped the existing supply network.

We put a lot of effort into building a customer base for some of these companies and it is heart breaking to see all of that effort going down the drain. Worse, the customers we had to inform about the broken relationship, often held us responsible. Consequently, the effect could well poison the entire relationship.

## The Xsensior Years

Around about 2010, we noticed a gap in the products we were selling. There was room for a simple temperature measuring device that required the very minimum of configuration.

{{< figure src="images/EnvironmentAd.gif#floatright" alt="Xsensior online advert" >}}

Xsensior was born to fit into that brief. Xsensior was a cheap USB thermometer combined with a Microsoft Windows based GUI to log and display the data as well as alert when things go wrong. In addition, we added a cloud version of the software called Xsensior Live.

Producing the software was one of the highlights of my time at OPENXTRA. It was an exciting time when everything seemed possible. As ever, reality has a habit of getting in the way. The big problem we had was that non one had any electronic engineering skills. We could do the software side but we just didn't have the hardware ability to design our own gadgets. This became quite a big limiting factor on Xsensior and effectively killed it when we were unable to source the USB thermometers any more.

It was a missed opportunity because customers absolutely loved the product.

## Google Gave and Google Hath Taken Away

We had a good run. From mid 2004 until 2012 the website was an absolute ranking machine. I could put up a page and in a few hours we'd be top 5 for it on Google. Quite often even in relatively competitive areas too. You do begin to take it for granted after a while.

In 2012 we were hit pretty hard by one of Google's periodic updates. Google makes changes to their ranking algorithm and some websites go up and some go down. It was our turn to go down. We were not dropped down by much but the difference between ranking in first place for a search and ranking in third place is the difference between night and day.

Things are a bit different these days, the difference isn't so marked because all organic listings are so far down the page underneath all of the very large paid adverts. The result in \#1 position in 2022 is in the same place as \#3 or lower from the 2008 search results. (As an aside, see for a comparison of one [Google search result between 2001, 2008 and 2022]({{< ref "/posts/open-source-network-management-in-google-2001-vs-google-2008/index.md" >}}). You will notice just how far down the page the \#1 result is in the 2022 results.)

## COVID-19

It was only 23rd March 2020. But it feels like a lifetime ago. I knew something bad was happening a week before because my Father's care home went into full lock down.

You will not be surprised that COVID had some pretty large effects upon the business. First of all the environment monitoring end of the business pretty well disappeared overnight. Monitoring the server room became rather a small concern. And the sales of environment monitors soon reflected that.

Thankfully, being able to remote control the power to various devices located in the office whilst everybody is working from home became a much *bigger* concern. The only problem was that we had an early foretaste of the pernicious COVID supply problems. Because literally everybody in the world had exactly the same requirement and the manufacturers could not keep up with demand.

If it hadn't been for remote power switch sales in 2020, this post would have been written much sooner. :wink:

## The End

OPENXTRA has always been run quite conservatively. We don't have flash cars and our offices could politely be described as utilitarian. We've always kept things as lean as possible. We have kept a sizeable five figure sum in the bank for rainy days. This got us through the tough times of the *Great Recession*, the Google ranking drop and COVID-19. But we were lucky that each of the previous crises were well spaced out. We were able to slowly top up the rainy day fund between crises. Unfortunately, the most recent Ukraine crisis has come hot on the heals of COVID-19. We just didn't have the opportunity to build our rainy day fund back up after COVID.

There comes a time when you run out of road. The good trading conditions likely to appear after the Ukraine crisis is over are just too far away for us.

It has certainly been a roller coaster ride. I have certainly made my fair share of mistakes over the last twenty years. But I don't regret *any* of it.

## A New Beginning

As for me personally, I am busy up-training in DevOps. Cisco in cooperation with the Open University offer digital skills training. I am currently studying the Cisco DevNet Associate course. I already have quite a couple of decades Linux experience and a few years of using Ansible to deploy the website. Or, I might go back to programming full time.

I do seem to specialise in job hunting during a recession. When I first exited university it was during the early 1990s recession and here I am trying to do the same during the 2022 version.
