We are currently on our fifth full iteration of our website. And when I say iteration, I mean full gut wrenching, throw everything out and do it again iteration. That works out to over one full iteration per year.

We've used the simplest e-commerce system you can use, called [Mal's-ecommerce](http://www.mals-e.com/), through a [PHP based cart](http://www.jshop.co.uk/) and then eventually to our current system based upon [Elastic Path](http://www.elasticpath.com/).

Trust me, it's *hard*. But, that isn't the hardest part of e-commerce. The hardest part on the web is **trust**. Trust is way harder to imbue in your visitors than anything else.

The whole trust issue was reinforced to me yesterday. My sister's PC got infected with [spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware). As the family IT guy I got the call. Of all of the tools to cure the problem, all of the ones I'd heard of didn't work. So, how can I figure out which of the remaining tools I can trust? Well, you can't. You just have to guess.

Thankfully I guessed right but I had no real information to go on. The bad ones look just as good as the genuine ones.

How to go about imbuing trust in your website I will leave for another day.
