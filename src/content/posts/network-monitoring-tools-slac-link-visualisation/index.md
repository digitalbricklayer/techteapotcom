I thought it would help you to visualise the [increased competition in network management]({{< ref "/posts/an-indication-of-heightened-competition-in-network-management/index.md" >}}) by [producing a graph of the links](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pHoYvvxXcX1_j_OX3pzsJfQ) in the [Network Monitoring Tools directory @ SLAC](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/nmtf/nmtf-tools.html).
