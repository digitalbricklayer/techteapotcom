[Microsoft Visual Studio 2005](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx) has been out for over a year now. I would say that it is quite possibly the worst piece of software to come out of [Redmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington) for a very long time. I am amazed that they released it. I am mortified that they still haven't fixed it.

The bug that makes me fume is the Class View bug. Scroll down to a class you wish to view and just before you can click on the class you want to work on the view goes right back to the top again :(

Thankfully, service pack one is due soon. Why has it taken over a year to come out? The obvious answer is: where else are you going to go? Nowhere. Hence Microsoft really don't have to sweat it much. They can fix the bugs in their own sweet time knowing that everybody just has to sit it out.

And Microsoft wonders why they are so resented. It's not rocket science guys! The programming community doesn't like being treated like schmucks. We don't care about the new all singing and dancing new versions you are cooking up, we just want the current one to work properly.
