Apologies for the recent downtime. The site was down for half a day yesterday and for around an hour of business hours today. All is fixed now...phew! All was a bit of a panic for a while.

The problem for those interested in the techie bits was a PHP config problem. We are moving over to PHP 5 and the new version of PHP started interfering with the old version 4. The upgrade will be happening in the next couple of weeks or so together with a major overhaul to the e-commerce system.

Thank-you for your patience.
