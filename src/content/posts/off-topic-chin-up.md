I personally think the [doom &amp; gloom is being overplayed at the moment](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/hamish-mcrae/hamish-mcrae-its-bad-may-get-worse-but-its-no-great-depression-955492.html), every bit as much as the euphoria overshot during the boom years.

Things certainly are going to be different for a while, but I don't think we're all going to go back to depression era levels of unemployment and the social deprevation associated with it.

Whilst the various world wide responses to the crisis haven't been great, they've been a whole lot better than the response during [the great depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression).

One thing is for sure, people with deep pockets and an eye for the longer term, are going to make a killing.

**Note 2013/1/30**: Just shows how wrong you can be. I'm sure the folks in Spain, Ireland and Greece think the recession has been every bit as bad as the great depression. Not exactly been a picnic here either.
