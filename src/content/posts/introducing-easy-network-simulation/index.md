Paessler have introduced a new product called [Multi Server Simulator](http://www.paessler.com/serversimulator), currently available as a pre-release version, that creates a simulated network of devices and switches.

The main use for network simulators is for testing network management software. However, network simulators do have plenty of uses outside of software development.

If you are evaluating network monitoring software you may not want to unleash it on your live network. Network simulators like Multi Server Simulator allow you to create a test lab completely separated from your live network. There isn't much point in subjecting your network to a piece of software if it can't scale up to the job.

Unfortunately, within a few minutes of starting my evaluation Multi Server Simulator died a horrible death with the following dialog produced every few seconds.

Still, it's a nice idea...

***Update***: as there has never been an update to the software since the first beta release (26/5/2009) it doesn't look like Paessler is doing anything with this software, which is a shame really...
