A very interesting interview with The IT Skeptic over on the IT's About Uptime blog. The interview covers [ITIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL) and [CMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMDB) primarily with some background on [The IT Skeptic](http://www.itskeptic.org/) himself.

For those who haven't come accross The IT Skeptic, he tends to take a rather skeptical view of current IT service management practice.
