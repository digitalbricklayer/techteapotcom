I wish I'd known this 3 and a half years ago :smile:

When starting out in business or anything else where a website or email is important. I've got a bit of advice for you. I call it the **domain telephone test**.

Get hold of a colleague or friend, ring them up and arrange for them to ask you the website address and then the email address of your proposed domain.

If you can tell them the website and email address without having to spell anything out to them, without any clarifications, no misunderstandings then you have yourself a good domain. If on the other hand, you have to spell things out or they get the wrong address then maybe you should reconsider your choice of domain.

It's really quite obvious when you think about it, but it does get overlooked. When starting out in business there are a lot of things to think about. Sometimes the details do get overlooked. I see a lot of domains containing dashes. That's gotta be a nightmare to dictate over the phone.

So what happens if you do get it wrong? Well, the best idea is to buy the domains your customers think they are hearing. Then point the website over to your main site. Also, enable email on the miss spelt domain and forward to your main domain.

Guess what people always get wrong with our domain? Answers on a postcard to...
