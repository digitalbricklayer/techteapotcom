I doubt there are too many IT pros who haven't had [Repetitive Strain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) (RSI) at some point. My outbreak was induced by a long death march on a piece of network management software combined with bad posture and no breaks whatsoever. Whilst my immediate symptoms are gone, they return really fast after extended keyboard use. My need to avoid highly repetitive tasks is one of the variables I need to consider when I decide [whether a task should be automated]({{< ref "/posts/manual-vs-automated-process/index.md" >}}). No task in the long term is worth firing up my RSI again.

[Workrave](http://www.workrave.org/), available for Linux &amp; Windows, is an open source tool designed to help alleviate RSI by prompting you to take appropriate breaks and exercise.
