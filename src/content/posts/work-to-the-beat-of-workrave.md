I doubt there are too many IT pros who haven't had [Repetitive Strain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) (RSI) at some point. My outbreak was induced by a long death march on a piece of network management software combined with bad posture and no breaks whatsoever. Whilst the immediate symptoms are gone, they return real fast after extended keyboard use.

[WorkRave](http://www.workrave.org/), available for Linux &amp; Windows, is an open source tool designed to help alleviate RSI by prompting you to take appropriate breaks and exercise.

You only get <strong>so many clicks per day, so you better use them wisely</strong>!
