I need to create a CSV file using pipe (|) field separators and caret (~) field delimiters to feed some data into our e-commerce system. The format of the file is not under my control.

Excel is of no use whatsoever. Whilst I can use pipe field separators, I can't use caret field delimiters. Excel only supports single or double quotes or no field delimiters at all.

What are the alternatives?

- [Csved](http://csved.sjfrancke.nl/index.html) -- looks just the job except that it assumes fixed width fields;
- Windows notepad -- this would work OK, but would be pretty nasty to work with. All of the colums would be all over the place, so it would be difficult to ensure that all of the data is valid;
- Excel -- enter the data in the wrong format, and hope I can convert to the correct format later using something like [Windows PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx).

None of the alternatives is particularly appetising. Anybody know of a ninja CSV file editor? Help...!
