I read a total of 13 books in 2023. Of those 10 books were fiction. And of those 10 fiction books, 5 were fantasy. I hope 2024 brings a lot more fantasy books as I really enjoyed my selections this year.

I had a late spurt reading around the Lebanon hostage crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. I found Terry Waite's book absolutely superb. My book of 2023 is definitely **A Game of Thrones** by George R.R. Martin. For such a long book with so many characters, I never got to the point where I lost track of a character. Some feat in such a long and complex book.
