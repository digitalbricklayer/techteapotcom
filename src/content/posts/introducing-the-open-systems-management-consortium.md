There's a buzz going around at the moment in the open source systems management space. A new consortium, aimed at evangelising the best tools and companies, has been formed. The <a href="http://www.open-management.com/">Open Management Consortium</a> is a loose grouping of projects, organisations and individuals interested in how open source can impact systems management.

The consortium has a great page with all of the member projects and companies. I think you'll find much there to interest you. :wink:
