I finally got around to posting the [TimeTag](https://openxtra.org/project/timetag) source code up on ~~[Google Code](http://code.google.com/)~~ [GitHub](http://github.com/) this afternoon. You can find the project [here](http://github.com/openxtra/TimeTag).

Whilst I've no intention of working on TimeTag, I figured that it would be useful for people learning PowerShell development to have a reasonably large sample available, and useful for someone to have a help up if they wanted to implement something similar and don't fancy starting from scratch.

Feel free to fork...

**Update June 2013**: moved the code over to GitHub to make things easier to fork.
