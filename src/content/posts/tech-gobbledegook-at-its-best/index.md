Denis received a letter from [Agilent](http://www.agilent.co.uk/) advertising a technical seminar.

The letter starts thus:

>3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the Evolved UTRA project, which significantly enhances the current HSDPA/HSUPA based UTRA technology through variable bandwidth up to 20Mhz, a new air interface both on downlink (OFDMA) and uplink (SC-FDMA) and a new network design (SAE).

Hmmm, anybody got a translation for that? I've tried Babelfish but it can't make any sense of it.
