As a follow up to the [Windows based structured systems management]({{< ref "/posts/windows-based-structured-systems-management/index.md" >}}) post, I have found a network monitor that does have some dynamic abilities.

[PolyMon](http://www.codeplex.com/polymon) is an open source network monitor written for the .NET environment. Steven Murawski has written PoSHMon, a series of PowerShell cmdlets for interacting with PolyMon dynamically. Whilst neither PolyMon or PoShMon are particularly full featured or mature, they do at least show what is possible.

If anybody knows of any commercial network management tools with PowerShell support for dynamic structured systems management, I'd love to hear about it. :wink:
