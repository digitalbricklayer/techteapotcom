[Mark Hinkle](http://socializedsoftware.com/) from [Zenoss](http://zenoss.org/) sent me a link to an [interesting document he prepared](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgrmj57q_9g8pjxpdp) yesterday.

I think Mark may be over egging Zenoss "<em>clear market leadership</em>" but without any doubt their growth over the last year has been impressive.

Perhaps the most impressive thing to take away is that all of the projects featured have grown over the last year.
