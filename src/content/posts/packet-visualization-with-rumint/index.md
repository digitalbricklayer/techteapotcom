One of the tools recommended in [Chris Sander's](http://www.chrissanders.org/) [Practical Packet Analysis](https://www.nostarch.com/packet2.htm) book is called [Rumint](http://www.rumint.org/).

Rumint is a free, open source packet visualization tool available for Microsoft Windows (written in Visual Basic.)

Roomint's author, [Greg Conti](http://www.rumint.org/gregconti/), has a book to be published by [No Starch Press](http://nostarch.com/) called [Security Data Visualization](http://nostarch.com/securityvisualization.htm).

One problem I've run into with Rumint is that it doesn't work on my setup. I run Windows XP and I've got WinPCap 4.0.1. It looks to me like a problem between Rumint and the latest version of WinPCap. The problem is that Rumint won't show any network interfaces to sniff, so obviously things don't work too well. :wink:
