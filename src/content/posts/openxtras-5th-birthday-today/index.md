Many moons ago back in the mists of time, well late 2002, Denis &amp; myself thought it would be a good idea to start a company.

Today is the 5th anniversary of the incorporation of OPENXTRA Limited. Our likkle baby finally had a legal life of its own.

To celebrate we're treating everybody to a trip to see the [Sweeney Todd](http://www.wyplayhouse.com/events/event_details.asp?event_ID=600) musical at the [West Yorkshire Playhouse](http://www.wyplayhouse.com/). Should keep everybody in-line when it comes to pay rise time. Maybe we'll get into the pie business. :smile:
