FYI there is an [interesting interview](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid7_gci1266202,00.html) with [Chris Sanders](http://www.chrissanders.org/?p=102), author of <em>"Practical Packet Analysis: Using Wireshark to solve real-world network problems"</em>.

If you are new to packet analysis, you can [do a lot worse than read the book]({{< ref "/posts/practical-packet-analysis-book.md" >}}).
