It's kinda like seeing your grand father naked...if you're Linux anyway. [Multics sources in all its PL1 glory](http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/) is now available for your perusal. Surprisingly for a system conceived in 1965, the last [Multics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics) system was shut down only in 2000. Impressive.
