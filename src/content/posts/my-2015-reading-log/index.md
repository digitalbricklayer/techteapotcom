On the plus side, it has been a good year for books. I've had a run of superb books. I've tried to broaden the range of books I read. I've always been a sci-fi fan but not a great fan of ork and goblin style fantasy but I've made a conscious effort to try more contemporary fantasy and have been very pleased with the quality of work I've found.

I've read a total of 12 books in 2015, 10 fiction (mostly science fiction and fantasy) and just 2 non-fiction. Note to self, must read more non fiction in 2016. Neither of the two non-fiction books were particularly inspiring, but at least **The Silent Day: A Landmark Oral History of D-Day on the Home Front** gave me some insight into life in England during the preparations for D-Day.

My highlight of the year has been **Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline. The book is currently being made into a film directed by Stephen Spielberg. Can't wait :smile:
