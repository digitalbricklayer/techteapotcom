CRN Tech put network management solutions up against one another and gave Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold Premium v11 first-place for its robust features, strong troubleshooting capabilities and comprehensive reports. Engineers were particularly impressed with its feature set, price/performance and integration capabilities, giving it top marks across those three categories. [SolarWinds LANSurveyor 10 ](http://www.solarwinds.com/products/LANsurveyor/index.aspx)came second, with [AdRem Netcrunch](http://www.adremsoft.com/netcrunch/index.php) (personally I've not heard of this) third. The full article puts these solutions through their paces and is well worth a read.
