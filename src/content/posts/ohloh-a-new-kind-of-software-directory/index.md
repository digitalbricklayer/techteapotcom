Mark Hinkle over at Zenoss mentioned Ohloh, a new open source software directory. Good find Mark!

In [Black Duck Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/) own words:
> Ohloh is a new kind of software directory, combining community driven content with a unique source code crawler that monitors up-to-date development activity.

It's an old skool software directory with a bit of Web 2.0 *magic* thrown in for good measure. I don't think the community features are particularly new, you can vote for projects on [freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/). Perhaps the project suggesting tool is new?

**Update 2020/10/22**: Ohloh is now called Synopsis Black Duck Open Hub.
