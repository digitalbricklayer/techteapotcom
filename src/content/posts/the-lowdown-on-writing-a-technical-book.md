If you've ever hankered after writing a technical book then  [Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/) has [some advice for you](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/technical-writing.shtml) garnered from writing [IronPython in Action](http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/).

Sounds like a shed load of work for no money... something I seem to be specialising in at the moment. :wink:

<strong>Update</strong>: Michael has done a post [detailing his first quarter earning from IronPython in Action](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2009_07_18.shtml#e1111). Not a lot of money for two years work... the only thing worse paid than writing a book is writing open source software. :wink:
