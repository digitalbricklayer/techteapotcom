I have read a total of 14 books, 8 fiction (mostly science fiction and fantasy) and 6 non-fiction. Of the two autobiographies, I found Mark Ellen's **Rock Stars Stole My Life!** to be very good, taking the reader through the rock landscape of the 1960s to the present day through the eyes of a music journalist.

The book I most enjoyed was Neil Gaiman's **The Ocean at the End of the Lane**. Neil Gaiman was certainly my find of 2014. He manages to write quite original fantasy in a way that doesn't make the book feel like fantasy.
