One of the problems with Nagios is that initial set up &amp; configuration can be intimidating to the new user. There are a [number of methods for easing the initial installation problems]({{< ref "/posts/top-3-easy-nagios-setup-options.md" >}}), but you are still left with an intimidating configuration process.

One option is to use [Centreon,](http://www.centreon.com/) a (relatively) new front end for [Nagios](http://nagios.org/) with a more accessible web front end for configuration. Centreon is fully open source and is supported by [Merethis](http://www.merethis.com/), a French company, who also sponsor development of the project.

Centreon is similar in concept to [Groundwork Open Source](http://www.groundworkopensource.com/) though far narrower in scope.
