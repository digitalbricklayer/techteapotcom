I'm a sucker for engineering in the trenches stories ... some good ones I found today: [here](http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=995), [here](http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987) and [here](http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=695). There aren't enough of them documented. If you've got any I'm all ears. Engineers and engineering should be celebrated not just be the whipping boys for the sales and marketing folks.
