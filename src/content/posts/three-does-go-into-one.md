We are in the midst of server consolidation drive. Three servers will go into one!

The hack attack last week has certainly speeded things up, though it was always in the technology plan for this quarter anyway. The new server is very locked down with a nice heavy iron firewall in front of it. We also went for a RAID 1 system too. If anything is going to go, you can bet that it will be a disk. Our only major piece of downtime around a year ago has been due to a backup disk going down. With the RAID set-up, a single disk going down won't cause any downtime.

The consolidation should be invisible to you. The old servers will be kept around for at least another couple of weeks to ensure that the transfer happens smoothly. The big DNS switch-over will be happening next Friday afternoon 5pm onwards to minimise any potential problems. DNS should have propagated fully by beginning of play on the 28th January.
