Networks create lots of events. Sometimes thousands per minute.

Events can be SNMP traps generated by a server rebooting, syslog messages, Microsoft Windows event logs etc.

How do you know which events are important? The ones telling you something important?

That is where [event correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_correlation) tools come in handy. You feed all of the events into the tool, as well as a description of the structure of your systems, and its job is to flag up the important ones.

- [Simple Event Correlator (SEC)](http://www.estpak.ee/~risto/sec/) -- SEC is a lightweight, platform independent event correlation tool written in Perl. Project registered with Sourceforge on 14th Dec 2001.
- [RiverMuse](http://www.rivermuse.com/) -- correlate events, alerts and alarms from multiple sources into a single pain of glass. Open core with a closed enterprise product cousin.
- [Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools) -- a suite of tools written in Java including [Drools Guvnor](http://www.jboss.org/drools/drools-guvnor.html) - a business rules manager, [Drools Expert](http://www.jboss.org/drools/drools-expert.html) - rule engine, [jBPM 5](http://www.jboss.org/jbpm) - process / workflow, [Drools Fusion](http://www.jboss.org/drools/drools-fusion.html) - event processing / temporal reasoning and [OptaPlanner](http://www.optaplanner.org) - automated planning.
- [OpenNMS](https://www.opennms.org/) -- whilst not a dedicated event correlation tool, OpenNMS does contain an event correlation engine based upon the Drools engine mentioned above.
- [Esper](http://esper.codehaus.org/) (and [Nesper](http://esper.codehaus.org/about/nesper/nesper.html)) -- Esper is a Java based components (Nesper is a .NET based version of Esper) for complex event processing.

If you want a survey of event correlation techniques and tools, you could do a lot worse than read Andreas MÃ¼ller's master's thesis titled [Event Correlation Engine](ftp://ftp.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pub/students/2009-FS/MA-2009-01.pdf). It is a few years old, but is still pretty current.
