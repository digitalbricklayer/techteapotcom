Another strange COVID-19 affected year, another above average reading year. I read a total of 12 books during 2021. Of the 12 books, 8 were non-fiction. Seems to be a bit of a trend I've noticed. The older I get the more I tend to be attracted to non-fiction books. It isn't a conscious thing, come book choosing time I seem to veer towards non-fiction for some reason. If I was guessing as to why, I would suspect it is due to a bit of risk aversion kicking in. Fiction seems like much riskier proposition especially when a lot of fiction is pushing 400-500 pages and almost inevitably each book is port of a trilogy especially in my favourite genre science fiction &amp; fantasy.

My favourite book of 2021 was *Stoner* by John Williams. Nothing very exciting happens in the book, but the small events that did happen were of great significance to the protagonists in the book. A life, when all is said and done, boils down to significant interactions with very few people. Maybe a dozen if you are lucky.

My favourite non-fiction book is a fascinating book by Sir Trevor Phillips the erstwhile head of the *Commission for Racial Equality*. The book takes a look at how Britain manages diversity in a time of *superdiversity*.
