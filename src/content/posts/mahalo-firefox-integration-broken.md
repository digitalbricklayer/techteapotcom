Hey Mahalo, your Firefox integrated search is broken. Look at the images...[Add Mahalo to Firefox integrated search](/images/uploads/2007/08/add-mahalo.JPG) &amp; [The Firefox error message](/images/uploads/2007/08/downloaderror.JPG" title="The Firefox error message)

The error message is a bit misleading, because you can manually download the file [opensearch_desc.xml](http://www.mahalo.com/opensearch_desc.xml).

The fact that the file is present suggests:

- The Mahalo open search file is incorrect;
- Firefox has a poor error message for when an OpenSearch file is incorrect. Instead of saying that the file is incorrect, it says that it is unable to download it.

Thought you'd want to know. :wink:
