If you are involved in IT in the education sector in the UK you may find the [EduGeek website to be of interest](http://edugeek.net/index.php). Looks like a good place to join your fellow professionals for a good chin wag.

Oh, and the founder is also a [fan of the Test-Um Validator too](http://www.edugeek.net/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&p=57016#57016)!
