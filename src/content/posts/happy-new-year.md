I actually refused some chocolate last night...not often that happens! Geese, I need to get down the gym today. :smile:

I must confess that I've been looking forward to going back to work for the last few days. The highlight of my holiday was the annual family trip to the [pantomime](http://yorktheatreroyal.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/review-sinbad-the-sailor-8/) at the [Theatre Royal in York](http://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/). The [award winning performance](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2229144,00.html) was up to its usual high standard and I recommend a visit if you can make it...the performance runs until the 2nd February.

One nice find over the holidays was a [free online book for learning Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/). When combined with [Lisp in a Box](http://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/) you've got an easy way to learn [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language).

I've always hated the look of Lisp, all of those parenthesis and all, and I was determined to find out more. I confess that now I understand where Lisp is coming from, I understand why things are the way they are. You see, everything is a list in Lisp and that includes the language itself. Clever stuff...

Another time sink was [Blitzkrieg](http://www.blitzkrieg.de/), a real time strategy game set in World War 2, I bought yonks ago but didn't like. I now remember why I didn't like it. A game is not the same as a simulation and should never be confused with one. At times learning Blitzkrieg felt like learning WordPerfect with all of the different key combinations I needed to learn. Sudden Strike is a far better game. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my original game disks so that's why I had to play Blitzkrieg instead.

Normal service will now be resumed.
