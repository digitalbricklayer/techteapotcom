The Tech Teapot, or as it was originally called, the OPENXTRA Blog is one year old today. Ten categories, 186 posts, 156 comments &amp; trackbacks and more tags than I care to count and we're still going strong.

Thank you all for reading. A blog is nothing without readers and commenters. Extra special thanks to the following people:

[Chris Garrett](http://www.chrisg.com/about/) -- Sage [advice on blogging](http://www.chrisg.com/). Thanks Chris!

Robert Aronsson -- creator of the Intellipool software and blog

Tarus Balog -- principal for the [OpenNMS](https://www.opennms.org/) project &amp; [business](http://www.opennms.com/)

Alan Lord -- blogger over at [The Open Sourcerer](http://www.theopensourcerer.com/)

[Lukas Beeler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131112094643/http://projectdream.org:80/wordpress/about/) -- SMB IT blogger over at [Lukas Beeler's IT Blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20140817143458/http://projectdream.org/wordpress/)

I'd better mention my OPENXTRA colleagues too (they *do* read this!). :smile:

One thing I've learnt over the last year...blogging isn't as easy as some people make it look! Writing a good post takes far more time than I would have believed a year ago.

**Update**: Lukas Beeler unfortunately died some time ago. Rest in peace and thank you.
