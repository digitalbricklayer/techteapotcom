[AVTECH](https://www.openxtra.co.uk/avtech-software.html) have finally released the WiFi version of the [AVTECH Room Alert 3E](https://www.openxtra.co.uk/avtech-room-alert-3e.html). The new model is called the [AVTECH Room Alert 3W](https://www.openxtra.co.uk/avtech-room-alert-3w-with-wifi.html). The new model supports WiFi connectivity as well as all of the features you've appreciated on the wired ethernet model. The unit has a built in temperature sensor, with room for one more digital sensor, as well as room for one low voltage or dry contact sensor.

The new monitor will connect easily to the [RoomAlert.com](https://roomalert.com/) cloud service. Just configure the unit with your wireless network details, and the monitor will start uploading your sensor readings to your private data store in the cloud. You can of course switch off the cloud offering if you don't want it. You can also use your existing on premise Device ManageR to centralise your data collection and alarming.
