After a protracted wait, [RiverMuse](http://www.rivermuse.com/) has finally released its open source fault management system. Binaries for Fedora Core 9 are available for immediate download. More technical details when the source code download link works.

**Update**: oops, bit early on this, RiverMuse isn't officially released until 5pm today, 28 July 2009.
