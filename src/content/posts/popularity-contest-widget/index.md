**Update 2nd December 2008**: The Popularity Contest Widget has now [moved to the wordpress.org site](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/popularity-contest-widget/). All updates will now appear on the new site.

[Popularity Contest](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/) is a great [Wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/) for displaying your most popular blog posts. It powers the **Teapot Highlights** over on the right hand side of this post. :smile:

One thing missing from Popularity Contest is a [widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/WordPress_Widgets). We created one for this blog, so we thought we may as well share it for everybody else to use too.

~~Place the Popularity Contest Widget in your plugin directory (remember to strip the .txt off the end) then go to Presentation &gt; Widgets. You can then drag 'n drop the widget into your sidebar.~~

You can edit the title and the number of posts to display. Don't forget to press the **Save Changes** button.
