PowerTime is now available on Google Code. You can even browse the code without having to download anything.

The only problem I ran into was the size of the ECAD data set exceeded the quota given to new projects. I've now split the ECAD data set so that it is available for download but isn't versioned inside Subversion.

I'll be back onto PowerTime real soon now. Just having a rest doing some web work at the moment. Expect a first beta by the end of June.

Now we've got a decent wiki (courtesy of Google Code) I'll be adding some much needed documentation too.
