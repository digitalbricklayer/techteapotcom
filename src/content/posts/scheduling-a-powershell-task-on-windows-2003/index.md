[Mike Wilbur](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwilbur/default.aspx) provides a great post on [scheduling a PowerShell script to periodically run using Windows 2003](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwilbur/archive/2007/02/23/powershell-script-that-can-schedule-itself-to-run-later.aspx). Somehow I think that's gonna prove very handy when used in conjunction with PowerTime. :smile:
