I am currently messing around in the pits of .NET e-commerce. I thought it would be the last place I'd find open source inspired disharmony. But no, even here it is to be found. :wink:

OK, a bit of background.

[NOP Commerce](http://www.nopcommerce.com/) is an ecommerce platform based on Microsoft's open source ASP.NET platform. The project has been around for five or six years or so. Gets very good reviews too. Last year [SmartStore.NET](http://www.smartstore.net/) forked NOP. Nothing wrong with that, NOP is GPL'ed. That would be fine except for a clause in NOPs license which states that you must keep a link in your website footer to the project website unless you pay a small $60 waiver fee.

The problem, and the tension, comes from SmartStore.NET having removed the link requirement from their fork.

Whatever the legalities involved, and I am not legally qualified to comment either way, the SmartStore.NET fork doesn't feel right. The NOP guys have put a ton of work into the project and they deserve better.

The sad thing is that there is a lot in SmartStore.NET to like. Wouldn't a better option have been to merge the changes into NOP Commerce so that everybody wins?

Update: if you are after a .NET based e-commerce system then [Virto Commerce](http://virtocommerce.com/) is worth a look. Looks to be maturing qickly.
