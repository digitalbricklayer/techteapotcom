One of the things that has surprised me about running this blog has been the number of people who subscribe via email.

There is a much easier way to subscribe to this and many other blogs. <del>[Googe Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)</del> [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is a web based feed reader making it a snap to keep up with blogs or anything that provides a RSS feed all from a single place. If you've already got a GMail account, you can sign up very easily. If you don't then you can sign up very quickly in a couple of minutes. It will save you lots of time in the long run.

Here is a [Google Reader tutorial by Andy Wibbels](http://www.andywibbels.com/flash/google_reader.htm). There's also [another one by Capture the Conversation as well](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=65iL0Q97RCg). Google have got into the act too with [Google Reader in Plain English](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VSPZ2Uu_X3Y).

**Update March 2015**: Google have unfortunately scrapped Google Reader, I've moved over to [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) and find it very useful. You can use your existing Google account to sign-up as well.
