... [at least the public release anyway](http://www.rivermuse.com/trial/). I expect if you work somewhere interesting, then it may be worthwhile contacting them in the meantime.

[RiverMuse](http://www.rivermuse.com/) are aiming their offerings solidly at Tivoli, Micromuse and OpenView event correlation users. RiverMuse are going to be using an *open cor**e* strategy, so far blazed by Zenoss and Hyperic, in the network management space. The *open core* product is *RiverMuse FreeCool* and the feature added, for sale product, will be *RiverMuse ProCool*.

These guys must lead a charmed life, if anybody else tried to use the names above, they'd have a horde of lawyers snapping at their heals pretty darn quick.
