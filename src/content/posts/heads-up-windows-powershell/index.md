Just a quick [heads up about Windows PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx). Looks a really neat way to automate a lot of dull, repetitive admin tasks.

Windows PowerShell version 1 has now been released and is available as a free download for Windows XP and beyond.
