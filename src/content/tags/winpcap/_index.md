WinPcap is a free and open source packet sniffing library for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The library is compatible with [libpcap]({{< ref "/tags/libpcap" >}}) but the implementation is necessarily tailored to the Microsoft device driver model.

WinPcap is no longer under active maintenance and has not been updated since 2015.
