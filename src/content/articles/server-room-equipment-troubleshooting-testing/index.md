Equipment troubleshooting tests are used to determine if the failure of equipment is potentially caused by the environmental conditions in which the equipment is operating.

<!--more-->

The objective of equipment troubleshooting testing is to determine if the temperature and relative humidity of the air going into the equipment inlets is within the allowable range. Please see [Recommended Server Room Temperature]({{< ref "/articles/recommended-server-room-temperature/index.md" >}}) for more details about the allowable ranges.

## Monitor Points

Each monitor point should have a temperature and relative humidity sensor placed approximately 50mm in front of the equipment air inlet. All of the monitor points must be in front of an equipment air inlet. You do not need to place monitor points at the air outlets.

## Test Results

The data should be logged for a short period of time and then examined to ensure the environmental data is within the allowable range. If all of the data is within the allowable range, it is unlikely that environmental conditions are a factor in the equipment failure. If some of the data falls outside of the allowable range, either correct the environmental conditions or move the equipment to a location where the environmental conditions are inside the allowable range.

## Summary

Whilst it is unlikely that you will need to perform an equipment troubleshooting test very often, the test may prove very useful in the small number of cases when you do need it.
